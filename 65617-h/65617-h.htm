<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
SUSPICION.
</h3>

<p>
Many a wife, mother, and maid watched
the progress of our troops from point to
point in Egypt, from the bombardment of
Alexandria, with the subsequent landing,
up to the last telegram which announced
that the army had begun its auspicious
night march from Kassassin towards
Tel-el-Kebir, but none could do so with more
anxiety than had Olive Raymond and
Eveline.
</p>

<p>
To them and to how many loving hearts
at home were the next telegrams fraught
with terror and anxiety!
</p>

<p>
Olive was free to rush to the newspapers
as soon as they arrived.  But not so Eveline,
for so suspicious of her secret interest
in one who was far away had Sir Paget
become, that he absolutely kept them out
of her sight as much as possible; and she
had a terror in her heart that Evan
Cameron might be killed in action, and, for a
time, all unknown to her.
</p>

<p>
Great was her craving for intelligence.
She could not, like a man, go to clubs or
newspaper offices, when the latest
telegrams&mdash;often false ones&mdash;were posted up;
and often nightly she went to bed with the
agonising yet unasked question on her
lips, 'Oh, what has happened to-day in
Egypt?&mdash;what is happening <i>now</i>?' and she
had to scan the morning papers, if at all,
surreptitiously, eagerly, and feverishly, for
what she did not want to see.
</p>

<p>
How would she have suffered the old
Peninsula war time, when news and battle
lists appeared in the weekly and bi-weekly
journals more than a month, yea, sometimes
two months, after victories were won
(we had no defeats in those long-service
days), and after the grass was green above
the graves of our gallant dead&mdash;the men
that knew how to die, but never turn
their heel before a foe&mdash;when our regiments
fought for the historic glory of their
number, as steadily as for king and country!
</p>

<p>
Sir Paget knew the source of his young
wife's anxiety, and watched her grimly.
</p>

<p>
'How dull my life is with <i>him</i>, kind
though he tries to be,' thought the girl;
'we have not a thought, feeling, or
inspiration in common.  When with Evan, it
seemed all inspiration, and thoughts came
and went so fast.  He always brought
bright ones to me.'
</p>

<p>
He was her first and only love&mdash;the
love that leads a girl to see only ideal
perfection in the object so beloved.  Their
passion had been like the diva in of a
mid-summer night, and now they were to meet
never more&mdash;never more!
</p>

<p>
She recalled the words of the song he
was wont to sing to air of 'Rousseau's
Dream'&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'See the moon o'er cloudless Jura<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shining in the loch below;<br />
  See the distant mountain towering<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a pyramid of snow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Scenes of grandeur, scenes of childhood,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scenes so dear to love and me!<br />
  When we roam by bower or wild wood,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is lovelier when with <i>thee</i>!<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And, as she touched the piano, his voice
seemed to come to her ear again.
</p>

<p>
'Eveline!' she would murmur, dreamily,
'he called me Eveline&mdash;his own&mdash;yes, I
can hear his voice plainly now&mdash;plainly
I heard it at Dundargue, and on that last
evening at Maviswood.'
</p>

<p>
Then her eye would fall on her wedding-ring,
and a kind of shiver passed over
her.
</p>

<p>
She strove to read, but that was almost
impossible; her mind wandered from the
story, or sometimes certain passages struck
her painfully.  In a novel ('Out of Court')
one ran thus:&mdash;'she married him; she
ceased to love him, and she died, which,
on the whole, was a better fortune than
generally befalls the women who make
this <i>irretrievable</i> stumble on the threshold
of life.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! would I but die too; but I am
too young, and too strong!' she thought
bitterly.  'Our hearts choose for us, in
spite of us, and I chose Evan.'
</p>

<p>
Bound though she was to a husband
beyond her years, uncongenial, and, in
some points, unappreciative, she could
respect him, but she could never love
him; that was impossible.  Her love was
far away, where the shadows of the Pyramids
fell on the sands of Ghizeh, and the
pipes of the Black Watch sent up their
wild war-notes in the desert of Goshen.
</p>

<p>
She had still the companionship of
Olive, who, with her aunt, Lady
Aberfeldie, was lingering at Southsea.
</p>

<p>
'Take care, Eveline,' said the former,
warningly, 'lest this useless and hopeless
regret for Cameron becomes too apparent
to Sir Paget.'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot help it, however wrong and
sinful it may be,' she replied.  'I do my
best.  I let myself love him from the first
moment I met him, and knew that he
loved me&mdash;loved me well&mdash;before the secret
escaped him.  Many have admired me,
but,' she added, simply and sweetly, 'no
one ever spoke to me before as Evan
spoke, and I gave him all the love of my
heart; but to cherish it is, I grant you,
hopeless now.'
</p>

<p>
'Hopeless as mine; for now Allan, I
fear, loathes me, if he thinks of me at all,'
said Olive.
</p>

<p>
'I am very tired, Olive,' observed the
other girl, 'of trying to compel duty to
triumph over sorrow.'
</p>

<p>
In her soft hazel eyes there was the
expression of one who was always looking
far away at some horizon unseen by others.
Sir Paget was not so dull or so slow as
not to perceive all this, and to draw his
own deductions therefrom.  A change had
decidedly come over him since he detected
her emotion on the day the Black Watch
marched, and he had become captious,
fractious, jealous, and inclined to be
sneering, while watchful of every
expression in her face.
</p>

<p>
In the library one day she was looking
at a terrestrial globe on a tall and
handsome stand.  She saw that, as the crow
flies, the distance was two thousand five
hundred miles at least to where the Black
Watch were face to face with the swarthy
followers of Arabi; and, stooping, she
pressed her lips to Egypt in general.
</p>

<p>
'<i>He</i> is there&mdash;I here!  On the globe,
how short the distance seems!'
</p>

<p>
'What <i>are</i> you about, Lady Puddicombe?'
said a voice, sharply, behind her&mdash;the
voice of Sir Paget, who was jerking
his bald head forward most alarmingly.
'Kissing a globe!&mdash;what tomfoolery&mdash;what
strange fancy is this?'
</p>

<p>
'I was only examining it,' she faltered.
</p>

<p>
'Only examining it!' he snarled; 'very,
closely apparently, and in what quarter did
your geographical studies lie?  Why, your
lips were absolutely upon it.'
</p>

<p>
'A giddiness came over me,' replied Eveline,
ashamed alike of her sudden emotion
and enforced duplicity.
</p>

<p>
He eyed her viciously, and his eyes
glittered dangerously.
</p>

<p>
'At luncheon this afternoon you were
more dull and <i>distraite</i> even than I have
seen you before,' said he, peering at her
through his gold <i>pince-nez</i>.  'Now, pray,
what was the meaning of that?  What ails
you&mdash;what oppresses you?'
</p>

<p>
'It is very wrong.  I cannot help it,'
urged the girl, desperately.
</p>

<p>
'Like all the rest of the world, you were
thinking of&mdash;I suppose, Egypt?'
</p>

<p>
'I was, Sir Paget.'
</p>

<p>
'D&mdash;n Egypt, and everyone there!' exclaimed
the baronet, coarsely and savagely.
'What is Egypt to you, madam, in particular?'
</p>

<p>
'My brother&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Your brother&mdash;bosh, madam, bosh!
Don't think to hoodwink me.  A young
married lady should always make herself
agreeable, especially to her husband; it is
one of the first principles of good-breeding
and of wifely quality.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline coloured with pain and keen
annoyance at what these remarks implied;
but Sir Paget in his anger was not
disposed to content himself with them
alone.
</p>

<p>
'Kissing a globe, indeed!  To my mind
it is evident that you think less of your
brother than of your brother's friend&mdash;that
fellow Cameron,' he exclaimed, giving full
swing to his jealousy.  'He comes, I
believe, of a decent stock enough; but that
should not have encouraged him to act like
the other adventurer Holcroft with your
cousin, and dare to raise his eyes to you.'
</p>

<p>
'A decent stock&mdash;an adventurer!'
repeated Eveline; and then, as she thought
of Evan Cameron's long line of warlike
and heroic ancestors, as compared with
the peculiar line of the Puddicombes, she
laughed bitterly, while Sir Paget eyed her
questioningly, and said,
</p>

<p>
'It is fortunate you were separated.
Well, I suppose you won't die of a broken
heart, and all that sort of thing, like the
girls we see on the stage and read about
in novels.'
</p>

<p>
Roused at last by these coarse taunts,
Eveline said,
</p>

<p>
'Sir Paget, I thought you were ignorant
of the ways and meannesses of the
fashionable world; don't, please, adopt those
of sneering and being jealous&mdash;if, indeed,
that world is ever jealous, or can love
enough to be so.'
</p>

<p>
And, turning away, she took refuge in
a gush of tears, inspired by intense
mortification, while Olive caressed and strove
to soothe her.
</p>

<p>
'An absurd old man!' exclaimed Olive,
angrily&mdash;'a widower, too, who began life
by loving and marrying another&mdash;how dare
he treat you thus?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Olive, how shall I ever pass all the
long years before I die, and with <i>him</i>, not
Evan?'
</p>

<p>
'My darling&mdash;hush&mdash;this will never do,'
urged Olive, who became alarmed by the
chance of some new <i>esclandre</i>.
</p>

<p>
'I don't understand all this, Lady Aberfeldie,'
said Sir Paget, greatly ruffled, when
he saw that handsome and always serenely
calm matron; 'your daughter is an enigma
to me,' he added, ashamed to acknowledge
what he suspected and she perfectly knew.
'I sometimes surprise her in tears, and, if
I ask the cause, she pleads a passage in a
novel, or that her music made her sad.
Stuff and nonsense!  I should like to see
the book or hear the music that would
wring tears from me.'
</p>

<p>
'Try change of scene,' said Lady Aberfeldie.
</p>

<p>
Daily Eveline's hazel eyes seemed to
become larger and brighter, while her face
grew paler, and all the delicate rose-leaf
colour and complexion faded out of it.
The lines of her young features, if
sorrowful, were very sweet, and her eyes, if
somewhat sad, seemed calm in expression
now.  Yet the girl had ever before her
the last <i>haunting</i> look that Evan gave her
as he marched past, amid the wild
hurly-burly of the dense crowd that surged
around the departing Black Watch&mdash;the
long, silent, and indescribable look of those
who gaze their last upon the silent dead;
for dead she was to him!
</p>

<p>
At times, when quite alone, she would
linger on her knees, in prayer for his
safety, and that his days should be ever
happy&mdash;often with her open Bible before
her, but without looking at it, like many
honest folks, as if to have it there would
work a spell.
</p>

<p>
Her life, as yet, was one of constant
dread&mdash;the effort to hide her anxiety and
sorrow, with her recent love for another,
under a hollow smile.  She feared even
to sleep, lest in a dream the name of Evan
might escape her.
</p>

<p>
She would get over all this nonsense
in time, her mother thought; for in time
people get over everything.
</p>

<p>
Sir Paget thought he would take that
lady's advice, and try change of scene;
and conceiving, not unwisely, that she
would be infinitely better away from the
military associations of Portsmouth&mdash;the
incessant arrival and departure of crowded
transports, the marching in and out, the
bugling, drumming, and drilling daily and
hourly of 'those infernal soldiers' on
the grassy common between Puddicombe
Villa and Southsea Castle, he resolved to
take her abruptly to his house in London,
though the season was long since over,
the town and the parks empty&mdash;not that
the latter fact would affect Eveline in the
least.
</p>

<p>
'He is taking me to London, Olive dear,
away from you,' said she, sadly; for with
Olive alone could she commune in secret.
</p>

<p>
'He is wise.  London will not be
associated with Evan Cameron.  You cannot
think so much there as here by the
seashore.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall think of him, anywhere and
everywhere.'
</p>

<p>
'Change of scene, faces, places, and
people will do much.  Try, dear, to forget.'
</p>

<p>
But poor Eveline only looked yearningly,
and kissed the soft cheeks of her handsome
cousin, with much caressing and many
tears.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
AT TEL-EL-KEBIR.
</h3>

<p>
A letter from Allan Graham to Lady
Aberfeldie proved, by its introduction, a
very bitter one to Olive, and the source
of many tears.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
'Belbeis, September.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
'My DEAREST MOTHER,
</p>

<p>
'But for Evan Cameron of Ours
saving my life at the risk of his own in
action two days ago, I had not been alive
to write you this letter&mdash;the first I have
had time to attempt since we landed.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Evan!
</p>

<p>
'Whatever the mysterious influence was
that that scoundrel Holcroft possessed over
Olive is ended now, as I saw him fall
into the sea, where he was drowned like
a dog.  I could not help him or save
him, even had I been disposed to do so.
Strange it is that a blackleg, a sharper,
and worse, for such he became, should
have been preferred by her at Dundargue
to me, the companion and playmate of
her childhood&mdash;her cousin, her affianced
husband under her father's will, absurd
in its tenor though that document be;
and now, neither verbally nor in writing,
shall I ever refer to her again.  My
pride&mdash;if I ever had any&mdash;has indeed been
humbled in the dust, and by her!
</p>

<p>
'After quitting our camp on the evening
before last, we moved to the sandhills
above Kassassin, where we piled arms, and
the men lay upon the sand or sat in
groups, all chatting gaily and hopefully
of the coming conflict at Tel-el-Kebir.
</p>

<p>
'Carslogie, who was always in wild
spirits, was busy spouting Shakespeare&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thus far into the bowels of the land<br />
  Have we marched on without impediment,&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and so forth, and I overheard some of our
men remarking that he "was surely <i>fey</i>,"
when word was passed to stand to our
arms, unpile, and advance at one in the
morning.
</p>

<p>
'Never before, perhaps, did fourteen
thousand men get under arms so quietly,
so softly.  The orders were now issued
in whispers, and, noiselessly as an army of
phantoms, we moved off, our footfalls
muffled by the soft sand.  No moon was
visible, but we had a clear, starlit
Egyptian sky overhead.  No man was
permitted to speak or smoke, and our brown
helmets, red serges, and dark kilts seemed
to blend with the gloom.
</p>

<p>
'If the silence of that weird, solemn,
and impressive time were broken, it was
by the occasional rumble of an artillery
wheel or of a commissariat waggon, the
clatter of a rammer or a steel scabbard
against a stirrup-iron, as we advanced
through the gloom, expecting every
moment to hear the explosion of a musket
or a shrill shout from the scattered
Bedouin horsemen, who were alleged to be
scouting in the vicinity&mdash;men belonging
to the band of the Sheikh Zeid-el-Ourdeb.
</p>

<p>
'Dear mother, our Highland Brigade
led the advance&mdash;thank God for the
honour!&mdash;with the Indian contingent
under Sir Hugh Macpherson, having the
veteran Albany Highlanders as our support.
</p>

<p>
'Ever and anon there were brief halts
to enable the regiments to maintain touch
on the flanks.
</p>

<p>
'I cannot describe the order of our
advance as yet, nor would you understand
it if I did so.
</p>

<p>
'A silence that seemed something awful
reigned over the vast plain, and none save
the initiated could have imagined that,
formed in a species of semi-circle,
fourteen thousand men were approaching the
enemy's earthworks, ready to dash at them
like hounds at the deer when the leash is
slipped.
</p>

<p>
'Arabi's lines consisted of solid
entrenchments, bound together with wattles,
four miles in extent from flank to flank,
heavily armed with cannon, and having
ditches about nine feet deep.
</p>

<p>
'The 74th Highlanders were next the
canal, opposed to the most formidable
part of these works, where many of their
dead are lying on their faces shoulder to
shoulder, shot down in the act of
charging; next them were the Cameron, the
Gordon Highlanders, and then ourselves,
the Black Watch, each company with its
piper in the rear, ready to strike up the
onset when the time came.
</p>

<p>
'Every heart was swelling proudly and
wildly then, with the grand conviction
that every heart at home in Britain&mdash;and
dearer still among our native hills&mdash;would
exult in our triumph, for a triumph it was
sure to be.
</p>

<p>
'Silently, swiftly, and noiselessly we
swept forward to the attack.  No word
was spoken, no command given save in a
whisper, and not a shot was fired, as, with
fixed bayonets, we came within three
hundred yards of the Egyptian batteries, and
even then the soldiers of Arabi seemed
unaware of our presence.
</p>

<p>
'Suddenly an alarm was given, and a
terrific fire&mdash;a literal garland of
flame&mdash;flashed along the bulwarks, a storm of
lead went whistling over our helmets,
and the air seemed laden with the pinging
and whizzing of bullets, while cannon
boomed hoarsely, and the roaring rockets
screamed high in the air.
</p>

<p>
'The pipes struck up along the Highland
line, a wild cheer burst from every
man, and we advanced with a furious and
headlong rush, flinging ourselves into the
ditches and climbing up the scarp; all
weariness after the toilsome night-march
was gone; sore feet and thirst were alike
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
'And now for the first time the voices
of the officers were heard: "Come on,
Camerons&mdash;this way, the Gordons&mdash;forward,
the Black Watch!"  The marines
and the Irish regiments were on the right,
and bravely they went at the trenches,
too; but the <i>first</i> within them were the
Highlanders, and the first of these was
young Donald Cameron, of the Camerons,
who, as he leaped in with bayonet fixed,
was shot through the head just as we
carried the first line of works.
</p>

<p>
'The dim light of the early morning
enabled the enemy now to direct their fire;
for a minute or two we drew breath, poured
in some heavy file-firing, and again dashed
on, while one portion of our forces that
had passed between the redoubts now
opened a flank fusilade, which proved too
much for the Egyptians, who&mdash;all save
their wretched gunners, who were chained
to the cannon&mdash;fled wildly across the open,
where our fire mowed them down in
hundreds, while they rent the air with cries
of, "Ya Allah! ya mobarek!" (O God!  O Blessed!)
</p>

<p>
'Then it was that our brigadier rode
up and said to the 79th, "Well done, the
Cameron men!  Will not Scotland be proud
of this day's work!"
</p>

<p>
'So much for our share of it.
</p>

<p>
'On the other flank of the works, the
Horse Artillery were pouring in shell, till
the Royal Irish carried them at the bayonet's
point, after a regular hand-to-hand
fight, in which Major Hart shot an
Egyptian leader, who endeavoured to wrest
away his revolver.
</p>

<p>
'Our troops swept over the batteries on
every hand, and the enemy fled as rapidly
and hopelessly as those on the other side
of the Canal had fled before the
Highlanders, whose costume and fury alike
terrified them.  Arabi, we are told, informed
his people that "the Scottish soldiers were
only old women;" but now they dub us
demons.
</p>

<p>
'To hear our pipes send up their pæan
of victory over the battered and corpse-strewn
trenches of Tel-el-Kebir, was to feel
for a time that exultation of the soul which
is said to be worth a long life of dull and
sluggish quiet.
</p>

<p>
'The Egyptians did not present the least
appearance of order, but fled, a demoralised
rabble, at the top of their speed, flinging
away everything that might impede their
flight, and pursued by our cavalry and
Horse Artillery, who mowed them down
like sheep.
</p>

<p>
'As one battery swept past the flank of
the Black Watch, the gunners brandished
their swords and shouted 'Scotland for
ever!' and then we knew them to belong
to the new division of Scottish Artillery.
</p>

<p>
'To hear that cry in such a time of
supreme triumph was to make one feel
what those must have felt, who heard it
raised by the Greys at Waterloo and by
the Albany Highlanders at Kotah.
</p>

<p>
'The total casualties of the Highland
Brigade are two hundred and twenty of all
ranks.
</p>

<p>
'One of the first we lost was poor
Carslogie, the life of the mess.  He was shot
by a wounded Egyptian, to whom he had
just given a mouthful from his water-bottle,
and I blew out the miscreant's
brains.
</p>

<p>
'We have also to sorrow for our noble
Serjeant-Major, John M'Neill, whose tall
and soldier-like figure was long a feature
at the head of the column.  He cut down
several Egyptians with his claymore, but
fell at last, pierced by three wounds.  He
was, we know, the sole support of a
widowed mother, to whom he was tenderly
attached.
</p>

<p>
'The fight was fought and won in the
good old British fashion, with the cold
steel; the breech-loader has not yet
rendered the bayonet obsolete.
</p>

<p>
'The Guards and Highlanders made
themselves at home among the tents and
spoils of the Egyptians; but our soldiers,
flushed with glory and fresh from
conquest, no more spoke of the Gordons, the
Ross-shire Buffs, or the Black Watch, but
of Donald Cameron of the Camerons&mdash;the
young hero from the Braes of Angus, who
was the first in Tel-el-Kebir!
</p>

<p>
'Who could say what heroic blood was
in his veins, for his name was old as the
hills, when the Camerons were known as
the children of the Follower of Ovi.
</p>

<p>
'I had some narrow escapes.  A ball
carried away the pommel of my dirk.  I
had a bayonet thrust through my kilt, and
two shells exploded near me, covering me
with sand; but I had a closer shave than
that.  In the rush as I led on my company,
two powerful Egyptians in white uniforms,
with scarlet tarbooshes, seemed to devote
their energies to killing me, as an officer
or prominent leader.  Both attacked me
with their fixed bayonets.  By a circular
parry of my claymore, I turned one of
them aside, and ran the man through&mdash;or
near&mdash;the heart.  He screamed and grappled
me by the throat, dragged me down
amid the blood-soaked sand.  So savage
and powerful was his death-grip that had
he failed to strangle me, I must have
perished under the bayonet of the other, whom
Cameron cut down, through tarboosh and
bone to the chin, and then released me.  A
third who came up he pistolled, and I hope
Evan will get a clasp to his V.C. for this.
</p>

<p>
'The papers will, of course, tell you all
the rest&mdash;how we captured the standing
camp and immense stores of provisions
and plunder; how the victorious troops
advanced with tremendous cheers across it to
the railway station, where soon after Sir
Garnet came up; and how Drury Lowe
with his cavalry cut across the enemy's
line of flight, killing and capturing on
every hand.
</p>

<p>
'I know how my father, with his great
love of the old Black Watch, will appreciate
the story of our glory at Tel-el-Kebir;
but the aspect of the place was awful after
the firing ceased and the sun came up in
his morning splendour&mdash;a sight never to
forget, though I have seen some terrible
work in India.
</p>

<p>
'The dead lay about in scores and
hundreds, many disembowelled by shot or
shell; some with brains oozing out; others
with their heads literally blown off; and
some were scorched to death by their
clothing becoming ignited by the flame of
an exploded shell.  There were wounds of
every kind&mdash;by the bayonet, the rifle-butt,
and sword; and many of the maimed were
seen to cast aside their tarboosh and bury
their head in the sand for coolness, while
the cries for water were simply agonising.
</p>

<p>
'I found the third Egyptian from whom
Cameron's pistol had saved me.  He was
dying.  "Turn my head towards Mecca,"
I heard him say faintly to a comrade who
lay near him.  The fellah did so, and the
poor wretch passed away in peace.  I saw
some who died making signs of the cross,
but these, of course, were Coptic Christians.
</p>

<p>
'Two ill omens, it is said, occurred before
the conflict to chill the ardour of the
Egyptians.  In the fight of Kassassin a
man was shot through the heart by a rifle
ball, which pierced a copy of the Koran that
he carried there as a charm, and took a
part of it into his body.  The other was
the crescent of the new moon, which
encircled a star and sank with it below the
horizon just before the attack, and this,
being emblematic of the crescent and star,
was deemed ominous of defeat and destruction.
</p>

<p>
'Arabi has fled towards Belbeis, pursued
by Drury Lowe.
</p>

<p>
'The canal is filled with dead and dying
men and horses, yet our men are fain to
fill their water-bottles from it.'
</p>

<p>
This letter concluded with kindest
regards and wishes to everyone he knew and
loved, by name&mdash;Olive Raymond alone
excepted; and keenly and with tears she
resented the omission.
</p>

<p>
In hot haste Lady Aberfeldie wrote to
Allan, explaining the story of Hawke
Holcroft's surreptitious visits, his fancied power
over Olive, and the abstraction of the
unlucky diamonds; but owing to various
circumstances&mdash;the fortune of war included&mdash;the
letter was a considerable time of
reaching him to whom it was addressed,
and some stirring events occurred in the
meantime, before he could reply to it.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
AT GRAND CAIRO.
</h3>

<p>
The Black Watch had barely buried their
dead at Tel-el-Kebir before they were
sent by railway to Zag-a-zig; a breakdown
occurred on the line, and the regiment
slept for the night on the slope of the
railway embankment.  On reaching Zag-a-zig,
more fighting was expected; but the
Egyptians did not show face, so the
Highlanders were marched to Belbeis, from
whence Allan despatched the preceding
letter.
</p>

<p>
Belbeis is now a little town, about forty
miles from Grand Cairo, situated on the
borders of the desert, famous in the
Crusade of the twelfth century as the first
place captured by the Saracens, and held
by them as a fortified magazine for
supplies, and to this day it has a trade in
corn.  In the same century it made a
vigorous resistance to Amurath of
Jerusalem, and in more modern times it was
occupied by the French army to keep open
the communication between Cairo and the
coast.  Here a junction takes place of the
canals derived from different parts of the
Nile.
</p>

<p>
It had been reached by our cavalry on
the evening of the day Tel-el-Kebir was
captured, and after a slight skirmish was
taken possession of by Drury Lowe.
</p>

<p>
The Black Watch was eight days at
Belbeis, during which they had scarcely
any other food than hard biscuits and a
small supply of tinned meat, with muddy
water from the canal to wash them down
with; and as the knapsacks did not come
in from Tel-el-Kebir for five days, neither
officer nor private could have any change,
but slept in the kilt without blanket or
other covering, while nearly driven mad by
mosquitoes, sand-flies, and other plagues
of Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Arabi and Toulba Pasha had been
taken prisoners, and nothing was spoken
of now but the advance on Grand
Cairo.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the surrender of the Egyptian
position at Kafr Dowar took place.  On
its frowning batteries white flags in token
of peace were everywhere displayed, and
our troops entered without resistance.
The terrible lesson taught the enemy at
Tel-el-Kebir was not likely to be soon
forgotten.  Moreover, the firing of the
Egyptian infantry was always rather
defective, their Remington rifles being
sighted much too high for short distances;
thus, at the long range, their firing was
always better than at close quarters.
</p>

<p>
From Belbeis General Lowe pushed on
towards the capital, keeping on the borders
of the desert.  At every village he passed
through, the swarthy population came
pouring forth waving white flags and
declaring themselves faithful to the Khedive,
while masses of flying fugitives, on seeing
our cavalry overtaking them, threw down
their rifles and made signs of submission.
</p>

<p>
Galloping on without drawing rein, our
cavalry entered Grand Cairo, after a forced
march of fifty miles in thirty hours in
heavy marching order, and by that act
practically ended the war, and our troops
had no adversaries now but the savage
and plunder-loving Bedouins, who hovered
and hung upon their skirts intent upon
rapine and murder, as Allan Graham
and some others ere long found to their
cost.
</p>

<p>
The advance to Cairo was headed by the
Bengal Horse, led in person by Sir Hugh
Macpherson, though General Lowe was in
command of the whole.
</p>

<p>
On the 22nd of the month the Black
Watch left Belbeis for Grand Cairo, where
the corps arrived in the evening, when the
last rays of the setting sun tinted with
the hue of blood and saffron the water of
the Nile as it wound past the islets near
El Ghizeh&mdash;flushed and red, as on the
evening when, in long ages past, according
to Mohammedan legends, Joseph sank
Jacob's marble coffin in the stream; and it
was with no ordinary emotion of admiration
and interest that Allan and his comrades
beheld the capital of Egypt basking
in the sun ere he went down beyond the
hills.
</p>

<p>
'Skirted by groves and gardens,' says a
writer, 'its light airy structures seem to
be based upon a mass of verdure; long
lines of buildings, white, glittering, and
infinitely varied in form, rise beyond each
other, and the palace and citadel, cresting
a steep projection of the Mokattam ridge,
conduct the eye to the vast rocky barrier
which protects "the victorious city" from
the blasts of the desert.'
</p>

<p>
Streets of lofty and latticed houses
abounding in carved balconies and florid
arcades; the mosques, with delicate domes
and airy minarets, covered with tracery
and arabesques; the houses of beys and
grandees; the fortified abodes of the stern
old Mamelukes, now those of Egyptian
nobles, recalling in their architecture the
Moorish glories of the Alhambra and the
Alcazar of Cordova&mdash;a perpetual dream of
the Arabian Nights.
</p>

<p>
Even with night the bustle in its streets
did not cease; the coffee-houses and hotels
were filled with light, and, in the warm
atmosphere, teemed with outdoor life, for
there all who are afoot have lanterns, and
there were the tellers of Arabian tales, the
Nubian singer with his mandolin, and the
Egyptian magician performing such tricks
as one might think the devil alone could
do; and now once again, as in the days
of General Hutchison, the walls and
towers of 'the Queen of Cities'&mdash;El Kahira
of the fatalistic caliphs&mdash;re-echoed to the
British drum and the Scottish warpipe, as
the Highlanders defiled round it to their
camp, where the tents were pitched
outside the walls.
</p>

<p>
The soldiers were not allowed to enter
the city, except on duty or with a pass, and,
as a general rule, the latter was chiefly
given to sergeants.  This plan did not, of
course, apply to officers, thus Allan, Evan
Cameron, and some others lost no time in
making their way to an European hotel,
where something better than the repasts
they had partaken of at Belbeis and
elsewhere could be procured, and where, amid
a somewhat polyglot society, consisting of
Greeks and Egyptians, Hungarians and
Cypriotes, they supped at an open
window on a balcony overlooking a street
abounding with bazaars, and lanterns
swinging to and fro, crowded by people
and innumerable vendors of street
goods&mdash;turbaned or tarbooshed&mdash;the water-seller
tinkling his dishes and quoting the
Koran; the sellers of melons, of cresses
and lily roots, of flowers of henna,
wherewith to dye the nails of copper-coloured
damsels; little donkeys ambling everywhere,
and now and then a huge camel
swaying along; and more than once the
procession of a harem returning from the
evening bath&mdash;the women enveloped in
black garments and veils, with masks of
white linen.
</p>

<p>
Amid the scenes of warfare the organ
of wonder becomes blunted considerably,
and thus after a time Allan, soothed by the
fumes of a fragrant havannah, and weary,
perhaps, with the events of a long day&mdash;the
entraining and detraining of the
regiment, its baggage and stores, and so
forth&mdash;fell sound asleep in his chair,
oblivious of the clatter of voices in
the large room of the hotel, and the
many sounds in the street below; while
Cameron, re-entering the room, idled over
an album of views of Grand Cairo and its
vicinity.
</p>

<p>
Allan's short sleep was a restless one,
for there came before him a vivid recollection
or vision of Hawke Holcroft, and his
pale face, with its last expression of
horror and despair, as the waves closed over
it and sucked him down.
</p>

<p>
A little cry that escaped him made
Cameron look his way, and he saw a
man, in the dim light without, regarding
Allan with a fixed and hostile expression.
He was clad somewhat like a European,
but wore a tarboosh, with a blue tassel,
and had a voluminous beard; and his eyes
seemed savage and sinister in expression.
</p>

<p>
It is said that there is some mysterious
and magnetic force in a long and fixed
stare or gaze; and there is, it is also
said, 'within us some vigilant quality that
is only exercised when every other faculty
is at rest, that permits all ordinary sounds
to pass unheeded while we sleep, but that
instinctively sounds the alarm when
anything unusual or fraught with danger is
at hand.'
</p>

<p>
Be all that as it may, Allan suddenly
awoke, and started up, and the watcher
as suddenly vanished, but not before his
pale and sinister face had been seen by
the wakener.
</p>

<p>
Cameron sprang out on the balcony.
There was no one there, save his comrade,
and it was evident that the lurker must
have passed into the hotel by some other
window.
</p>

<p>
'A dream,' muttered Allan, looking
rather confused, 'a dream of that wretch
Holcroft.  Why should his face haunt
me?  I did not kill him&mdash;he drowned
himself; and I need have no more
remorse for that affair than for pistoling
the fellow who shot poor Carslogie.'
</p>

<p>
'Whether the cause of your dream or
not,' said Cameron, who was too genuine
a Highlander to be without a considerable
spice of superstition in his nature, 'a
fellow lurked beside you whose look I
little liked.'
</p>

<p>
'What was his appearance?'
</p>

<p>
'Difficult to describe in the dim light,
but the gleam of his eyes was sinister.
Some disbanded Egyptian turned thief,
most likely.  But he bolted the moment
I approached, and you awoke.'
</p>

<p>
'All this is a strange coincidence,' said
Allan, as he lit another cigar; and they
turned their steps towards the camp
without the walls.  'But I am not much given
to dreaming, and our work has been too
hard for some time past for indulgence
in long naps, yet I had a strange and
creeping sense of some evil presence near
me, with a pain that was strange and
intolerable.'
</p>

<p>
But Allan had not seen the last of the
man with the tarboosh.
</p>

<p>
Before returning from history to our
narrative and the adventures of our
friends, it is impossible to omit reference
to the impression made on the population
of Alexandria by the warlike aspect
and stately bearing of the Black Watch
and other Highland regiments at the
review, in the great square before the
Abdin Palace, the official residence of the
Khedive, whom our forces had now restored
to place and power.
</p>

<p>
To see our eighteen thousand troops go
past, the palace was crowded, not only
at every window, but on its flat roof, and
the Viceroy's wife, who had shared all
his perils, was there with her children,
and the closely-veiled ladies of the harem.
The streets were lined by multitudes of
curious but stolid Egyptians, not more
inclined to hiss than cheer, feeling no
sense of shame for their recent defeats
and humiliation, but only one of quiet
amusement and desire to behold a spectacle
that did not cost them a piastre.
</p>

<p>
After the blue jackets, the Guards, and
others had passed, the brass bands
stopped, and then were heard the pipes and
drums, as, led by its one-armed general,
the Highland Brigade, every company
steady and straight as a wall, the ranks
well 'locked-up,' every officer and man
looking stately and graceful in his waving
tartan, came on at a swinging pace, amid
mutterings of <i>Scozzezi diaboli nudi</i>.
</p>

<p>
Their general, Sir Archibald Alison, in
honour of the occasion, wore a sprig of his
native heather in his helmet.  The idea
had got abroad, said the <i>Times</i>, 'that the
Highlanders, who bore the brunt of the
fighting, who were the first in the trenches,
and who suffered most severely, had been
rather ungenerously ignored in official
despatches.  At all events, the crowd
seemed disposed to grant unofficial honours,
for the second cheer of the day was
accorded to the Black Watch, easily
distinguished by their red plumes, and led by
Colonel Macpherson, also sporting the
heather,' and exciting more interest even
than our brown-clad Punjabees or the
Belooches, in their black and red uniforms,
tall and strapping fellows though they
were; and with them came the heroes of
Candahar, the Seaforth Highlanders, wearing
Mackenzie tartan, covered with medals,
and marching past as old Scottish soldiers
can.
</p>

<p>
Then it was that the <i>Times</i> reporter
heard an Italian say, '<i>Poveri Egiziani</i>!  If
you had only seen them before, instead of
<i>after</i>!'
</p>

<p>
The Black Watch were halted for a
minute or two, prior to marching back to
camp, when suddenly Cameron said to
Allan, in a loud whisper,
</p>

<p>
'Look&mdash;there is the fellow I saw on the
hotel balcony.'
</p>

<p>
Allan turned, and amid a crowd of
Egyptians, Italians, and jabbering and
gesticulating <i>bheesties</i> and <i>syces</i>
(water-carriers and grass-cutters), belonging to
our Indian contingent, he saw a man with
a fair beard and a pallid face regarding
him steadily with keen eyes and knitted
brow; but, the moment he turned towards
him, the stranger shrank back amid the
crowd, and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
'Hawke Holcroft, by heaven,' exclaimed
Cameron.
</p>

<p>
'Impossible!  He is dead,' replied Allan,
feeling curiously uncomfortable nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
'I would I were as sure of a thousand
guineas,' said Cameron.
</p>

<p>
'One reads of such things only in
romances&mdash;yet the eyes and beard were the
colour of those of Holcroft.'
</p>

<p>
'Truth is always strange&mdash;"stranger
than fiction," as Byron tells us.'
</p>

<p>
'Stranger, indeed, should this prove the
case.  But, if alive, how comes he here,
and why does he seem to dog me?'
</p>

<p>
'I regarded him at first vacantly, then
with indistinct recognition, and anon with
certainty, though the beard and red
tarboosh disguise him so much!'
</p>

<p>
Allan Graham knew not what to think.
If the man referred to was actually
Holcroft, by what miracle was he then in
Grand Cairo, and how was he rescued from
the sea?  Strange it was, indeed, that if
the lurker at the hotel was he, Allan
should dream of him at the moment of his
appearance in the balcony.
</p>

<p>
'There is always a skeleton in every
fellow's cupboard, and Hawke Holcroft
was the skeleton in mine, poor devil!' said
Allan.
</p>

<p>
'You are still disposed to think and
speak of him in the past tense?' observed
Cameron, whose mind was made up as to
his identity.
</p>

<p>
'I cannot do otherwise, but the moment
the parade is dismissed we shall make
inquiries at the hotel.'
</p>

<p>
They did so, but in vain.  No person of
that name or appearance was known there.
</p>

<p>
Instead of being put into the comfortable
barracks of Kasr-el-Nil in the city, the
Highland Brigade was kept in camp while
October and November crept on, and this
time was not entirely a peaceable one; for
in the former month the Bedouins, who
were greatly puzzled with their garb, and
conceived them to be the English soldiers'
wives all camped in one quarter, thought
to make a dash there, and secure a few
'moon faces' to embellish their tents in
the desert.
</p>

<p>
A body of them belonging to the band
or tribe of Zeid-el-Ourdeh, the sheikh of
Jebel Dimeshk, a mountain range that lies
north-eastward of Grand Cairo, came
swooping down upon the Highland lines
with this view, and a result which very
much bewildered them, for the Scottish
forces turned out with rifles and fixed
bayonets, and in a very few minutes more
than forty amorous Bedouins bit their
native dust.
</p>

<p>
On several other occasions the spiteful
natives amused themselves by firing at a
distance among the tents at random, and
one evening a bullet whistled through
Allan's tent within an inch of his head,
thus necessitating some severe patrol
duty.
</p>

<p>
It was while encamped here that he received
Lady Aberfeldie's letter explaining
the apparently false position in which the
villainy of Holcroft&mdash;combined with his
spite, avarice, and desperation&mdash;contrived
to place Olive Raymond.
</p>

<p>
'Look here, Evan,' said Allan, to his
<i>fidus</i> Achates, in a grumbling tone, 'read
this letter from the mater.  I don't know
what to think of this strange story; but,
without some other proofs, if she thinks
we are going to kiss again with tears as
the poet has it, she is very much mistaken.
The mater says that Olive's own
unruly heart has perhaps made a shipwreck
of her life, whatever that may mean.
Poor girl, what a fool she was not to
confide more completely in me!'
</p>

<p>
In his tone tenderness was blended with
bitterness and regret.
</p>

<p>
From this little speech Cameron was
hopeful that all would come right in the
end; but a short time was given them to
think or talk over the matter, as both were
hurriedly sent with a detachment consisting
of about half-a-company&mdash;Allan, of
course, in command&mdash;to a place called
Matarieh, near Heliopolis, to take part
there in a demonstration against the
prowling Bedouins among the mountain ranges
that overlook the desert traversed by the
disused railway that ran from Cairo
towards the plain of Muggreh.
</p>

<p>
And for this place, which lies some miles
north-east of Cairo, they marched accordingly,
taking with them provisions, ammunition,
and tents, for the modern village
was a small one, situated among the ruins
of the ancient town, which was deserted
far back as the days of Strabo, and is now
to be traced only in extensive mounds of
earth and a noble obelisk nearly seventy
feet in height; and there disasters
occurred which Allan Graham was fated never
to forget.

CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
THE TELEGRAM.
</h3>

<p>
'By Jingo, there is old Pudd's carriage at
the door, and his wife in it&mdash;a deuced fine
girl, a stunning girl indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'Queer time this, to bring her up to
London, when there is not a soul in
town.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps that is the very reason he has
done so.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll invite old Pudd down to the
cub-hunting, and, if he brings her with him,
won't I improve the shining hour!'
</p>

<p>
The speakers were two very <i>blasé</i> but
good-looking young men, who were lounging
in the bay window of the otherwise
empty room of a stately club-house overlooking
Pall Mall, then lonely, dusty, rather
sun-baked, and the chief figures in
which were the sentinels of the Guards at
the War-Office and Marlborough House,
and who, with no small interest, had seen
Sir Paget Puddicombe's open carriage drop
him at the door, where he waved his hand
to Eveline as she drove away to shop or go
round the park.
</p>

<p>
Now, Sir Harry Hurdell, a sporting
baronet, well known on the turf and at
Tattersall's, and his chief chum, Mr. Pyke
Poole, a famous hand at billiards, more
skilled with the cue than any marker in
London, were not Sir Paget's style of men,
for both were horsey, fast, given to
gambling and loose living, but both were
anxious to stand in the good graces of one
who, as they phrased it, 'was proprietor of
such a devilish handsome girl.'
</p>

<p>
They had not seen him since his
marriage, on which both complimented and
congratulated him in such well-chosen
terms that he felt quite flattered, and his
heart warmed to them.
</p>

<p>
It flashed upon him that by the society
of other young men it was possible to
neutralise&mdash;if he did nothing more&mdash;the
recollection of Evan Cameron in the mind
of Eveline, and thus it was that he said,
</p>

<p>
'We are quite alone in town, but will
you dine with us to-day?'
</p>

<p>
'With pleasure&mdash;delighted&mdash;charmed to
be introduced to Lady Puddicombe,' said
Sir Harry, with a swift glance at his friend
Poole.
</p>

<p>
'Sharp eight, then.  I daresay our chef
will not fail us.'
</p>

<p>
'All right.'
</p>

<p>
'Good-morning,' and away he went.
</p>

<p>
The friends looked at each other, each
with an eye half closed, and then laughed
heartily.
</p>

<p>
'I'll have him down at the Hall for the
cub-hunting,' said Sir Harry, 'and have
other sport than that.  She'll soon get
tired of her fogie&mdash;is bound to do so.
What young girl could tolerate such an
old pump, and why shouldn't I go in and
win at a canter?'
</p>

<p>
'Hawke Holcroft knew her people,
didn't he?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;before he came a cropper altogether.
When last I heard of him he was
actually a visitor at their place, Aberfeldie,
wherever that may be.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline heard with total indifference
that they were to have guests that
evening, and with all his admiration of her Sir
Paget thought,
</p>

<p>
'What a fool I was to marry her, knowing
or suspecting what I did&mdash;that she
loved that fellow&mdash;loved him first (me she
never loved at all) and last, and loves him
now, no doubt.  They say no woman ever
forgets her first love, simply because he
was her first.  Pleasant for me!'
</p>

<p>
Like the hero of a recent novel, 'he
could not forget that his wife had loved
another man better than she ever loved
or even pretended to love him.  It was
her <i>candour</i> he felt most keenly.  Had she
been willing to play the hypocrite, to
pretend a little, he would have been much
better pleased.'
</p>

<p>
She loved Evan still; but it was with a
love purified of every sensuous thought,
of every earthly hope.
</p>

<p>
To Sir Paget the story of how Allan's
life had been saved at Tel-el-Kebir by
Cameron was a source of profound irritation,
annoyance, and mortification, as he
knew but too well how the event must
enhance the latter in the estimation of
Eveline, in whose heart gratitude and
admiration for high courage would now be
added to love.  He would rather have
heard that the two friends had been shot
down together.
</p>

<p>
With all her secret love for Evan, she
was too wise and modest to desire ever to
be face to face with him again.  She felt
that they had parted in the belvidere at
Maviswood never to meet again; that
henceforward he was as if dead to her;
but it was a delicious privilege to hear of
him and of his bravery, and that her dear
brother owed his life to Evan's courage
and Evan's sword.
</p>

<p>
She felt that a change had come over
the tenor of Sir Paget's ways of late, more
especially since the episode of Tel-el-Kebir.
</p>

<p>
Not a day&mdash;scarcely an hour&mdash;passed
over her head in which she was not made
to feel keenly the utter want of sympathy
that existed between herself and the man
to whom she had been married by her
parents&mdash;sold by them&mdash;as in the
bitterness of her heart she thought it.
</p>

<p>
He said sharp things to her, and made
bitter asides when Egypt or the war there
was casually mentioned, as, of course, it
constantly was; he shot many a poisoned
arrow; but Eveline never blushed, though
she felt a calm, cold scorn at the cruelty
and injustice of such conduct.
</p>

<p>
So here were a couple bound together by
the strongest of all the legal ties, yet
utterly unsuited to each other by age,
thought, and habits; yet most punctilious
was poor Eveline in the performance of
every wifely duty she owed her captious
old man; but a sickly dread of coming
sorrow pervaded the girl's mind every
morning she quitted her pillow, and it
came sharply and surely at last.
</p>

<p>
To dare to look at a newspaper was
sufficient to worry him.
</p>

<p>
'So, so,' he would say; 'thus it is&mdash;is
it?  Egypt and the Black Watch.  D&mdash;n
the Black Watch, I say!  Where is the
affection that you as a good woman&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I am only a girl,' she urged, piteously.
</p>

<p>
'As a good woman, say I, should feel
for her husband after marriage, even if
she felt none of it for him before that
little ceremony&mdash;for little and trivial
doubtless it may appear to you, madam&mdash;and
your regard for me should be all the
deeper and more lasting that no vain
protestations preceded it.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline made no response, but resumed
her occupation of gazing listlessly from
the back window of the drawing-room
into one of those dull and flowerless
London gardens which a writer has truly
described as looking 'like a burial place
without any graves;' so Sir Paget returned
to the charge.
</p>

<p>
'It is said, when love fails to beget
love, it often engenders hatred.  Is it so,
madam?'
</p>

<p>
'Not in our case, I hope,' said Eveline,
wearily, as she sighed, and her slender
foot in its satin shoe began to tap the
carpet with nervous impatience.  'Why
did you marry me&mdash;buy me from papa?'
she asked, with a tone and bearing a little
unusual in her, she was ever so gentle and
meek.
</p>

<p>
'I married you because I admired your
beauty, and believed in the love that would
come after marriage&mdash;the love that is
grounded not on childish fancy, but on
tried friendship and esteem.'
</p>

<p>
'Then you believed in too much,' said
Eveline, driven desperate.
</p>

<p>
'Too much?' he repeated, changing
colour, and jerking his head forward.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Sir Paget.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!  I asked you to be my wife in
full assurance that I should never find my
confidence in you misplaced.'
</p>

<p>
'You asked mamma rather, and your
confidence has not been misplaced.'
</p>

<p>
Then she paused and coloured deeply
for the first time, as she recalled that
painful and passionate interview in the
belvidere at Maviswood, and Evan Cameron's
farewell glance; two episodes that
seemed to have happened years ago.
</p>

<p>
Thus had a life of jealousy and 'nagging'
begun for poor Eveline&mdash;a life that
was ere long to become almost insupportable&mdash;for
the most trivial matter was liable
to misconstruction, or to excite suspicion.
</p>

<p>
If her eye followed a soldier in the
street, which, as the daughter of a line of
soldiers, was in her not unnatural; if she
ventured to speak of the news of the day,
or glance at a public journal, he watched
her; it was 'Egypt again!' that she was
thinking about; and, sooth to say, in that
suspicion he was not far wrong.
</p>

<p>
Punctually a few minutes before eight,
Sir Harry Hurdell and his friend Mr. Pyke
Poole were ushered into the drawing-room,
and she received them with as much
sweetness, ease, and grace as if no gloomy
conversation had preceded their appearance,
and she and Sir Paget billed and
cooed from hour to hour.
</p>

<p>
Fresh from the clever hands of Clairette
her toilet was perfection, and her appearance
excited the admiration of her husband's
friends, who were both connoisseurs
of female beauty, and disposed to be all
the more appreciative that the husband
was, as they thought, 'such a devil of a
fogie.'
</p>

<p>
'I mean to have Sir Paget down at my
place for a little cub-hunting,' said Sir
Harry, glancing in a mirror at his
accurately-parted fair hair and pointed
moustache; 'and, if so, I hope you will
accompany him.  My sister Lucretia will
make you most welcome, Lady Puddicombe.'
</p>

<p>
Ere Eveline could respond, Sir Paget
warmly accepted for both, again believing
much in change of scene and change of
society.
</p>

<p>
'I can mount you to perfection, Sir
Paget, or you may send down your own
horses,' said Sir Harry, his eyes
wandering in secret admiration over the fair
face, the soft, hazel eyes, and delicate
contour of Eveline's head, neck, and little
white ears.
</p>

<p>
Sir Paget thought he would prefer his
own.  Strange horses had often tricks
that might prove troublesome to a cavalier
of his years and proportions, and it was
carried that the first week of October
was to find him and Lady Puddicombe
at Hurdell Hall.  But Sir Paget could
little foresee the terrible and startling
events to which the apparently simple
acceptance of a hospitable invitation was
to lead.
</p>

<p>
'You have just come from the club, I
presume?' said Sir Paget to his brother
baronet.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; just waited to see the last
telegrams in the reading-room.'
</p>

<p>
'Anything fresh from Egypt?' lisped
Mr. Poole, with his glass wedged in his eye.
</p>

<p>
'Only a single telegram, which, by the
way, must interest you.  Lady Puddicombe,'
said Sir Harry, with a most serious
inflection of his Voice.
</p>

<p>
'Me&mdash;how?' faltered Eveline, feeling
herself grow paler, if possible, than she
really was.
</p>

<p>
'It refers to your brother.'
</p>

<p>
'My brother!'
</p>

<p>
She was pale to her quivering lips now.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; it states that an officer of the
Black Watch had been killed in action
with the Bedouins, and was buried in the
sand of the desert by his friend, the
Master of Aberfeldie.'
</p>

<p>
'And the officer's name?' said Sir Paget,
icily.
</p>

<p>
'Was Evan Cameron.'
</p>

<p>
'Cameron!' repeated the dry lips of
Eveline, who suddenly felt as one in a
dreadful dream.
</p>

<p>
Dead and buried; buried in the sand
of the Egyptian desert!  Did she hear
aright&mdash;was this happening to herself or
to some one else?  She made an effort
to speak, but her tongue had lost its
power.
</p>

<p>
'Eveline,' she heard her husband say,
'your wits have gone wool-gathering.'
</p>

<p>
'I beg your pardon, Sir Paget.  What
is it?' she asked, faintly.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Sir</i>!  Can't you call me Paget?' said
he; and the two guests exchanged glances
as much as to say,
</p>

<p>
'What is up now?'
</p>

<p>
At that moment the dinner-gong sounded,
and giddily and mechanically she took
the proffered arm of Sir Harry.
</p>

<p>
Never while life lasted would Eveline
forget the grotesque horror of that little
dinner, with the solemn servants in
attendance, and all its splendid yet, to her,
sickening details and talk, the references
to marriages and races&mdash;hurdle, steeple,
and others&mdash;on the <i>tapis</i>, of flirtations and
gossip&mdash;how terrible, how ghastly they
all sounded to her, who felt as if in a
mist, out of which their voices seemed
to come hollowly, and from a vast distance,
and she was compelled to listen with one
face&mdash;a dead face&mdash;coming out of that
mist before her!
</p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
DEAD AND BURIED IN THE SAND.
</h3>

<p>
How she acquitted herself as hostess, how
she got through that dinner, with its
many <i>entrées</i> and courses, from the soup
to the fruit, she never knew.  It passed
like a phantasmagoria&mdash;a dreadful
dream&mdash;but it was over at last; and, as one
in a dream, while Sir Harry held open
the door for her, she passed from the
table, not to the drawing-room, as he
naturally thought, and where he meant
speedily to join her, but swiftly to rush
to her dressing-closet, to tear off her
ornaments, and fling herself despairingly
upon a couch.
</p>

<p>
She recalled her strong but daily
presentiment that something was about to
happen, though now the war in Egypt was
virtually over, and that terrible something
had happened at last.
</p>

<p>
Could the telegram have been a
mistake?  Improbable and impossible!
Though brief, it seemed too distinct in its
grim details.
</p>

<p>
She felt as if suffocating with grief, and
her brain reeled at the feeble prospect of
concealing it from the already exasperated
Sir Paget.
</p>

<p>
She recalled Evan's words when he
parted with her at Maviswood, and how
prophetic they seemed now,
</p>

<p>
'I am going far away, my darling, and
shall never see you again.  That I may
find a grave in Egypt is the kindest wish
you can have for me.'
</p>

<p>
And now he had found that grave, and
he was buried by the hands of her brother
Allan, not on the sunny slope of a dear
highland hill, or in the grassy glen where
his forefathers lay in Stratherroch, within
sound of the waves of Lochiel, where the
summer breezes and the summer birds
would be about his tomb, and the clouds
and shadows of a Scottish sky flit over it,
but in the desolate sand of cruel and
barren Egypt!
</p>

<p>
There had been no solemn ceremony by
his grave; he had not even a coffin,
perhaps, but was buried, as she had read of
others being buried, in a blanket only, and
there to lie in the wilderness, traversed by
the antelope and jackal, till the last
trumpet sounded.
</p>

<p>
She remembered his song at Dundargue.
Could it be that the manly and bright
young face, the love-lit eyes, were dulled
by death now, and that his fresh gay voice
was hushed for ever?
</p>

<p>
'Dead!' wailed the girl in her heart.
'Oh, God, that he might be raised up as
Lazarus was, even though we should never,
never cross each other's paths again.
My love&mdash;oh, my love!' she murmured,
in a hushed voice, as if the walls might
hear her.
</p>

<p>
'Only to the dead,' says the author of
'Mount Royal,' 'to the utterly lost and
gone, is given this supreme passion&mdash;love
sublimated to despair.  From the living there
is always something kept back, something
saved and garnered for an after-gift, some
reserve in the mind or heart of the giver;
but to the dead, love gives all&mdash;with a wild
self-abandonment which knows no restraint
or measure.'
</p>

<p>
She had felt at first a dull, vague,
sensation which became an acute pang when
certainty came upon her; but she dared
not as yet shed a tear.
</p>

<p>
Henceforward, as before, she had a part
to act&mdash;that of indifference.  If possible,
there must be no pallid face shown, no
haggard eyes; no tell-tale sighs must
betray the agony of heart&mdash;the great
sorrow that consumed her for the loss of her
dead love; and wonderingly she looked at
her white and already worn countenance
in her mirror.
</p>

<p>
Oh, that Allan were returned! from him
she would know all.  Allan knew the
secret of her heart, sympathised with it,
and would relate everything; but she could
not divest herself of an awful and
haunting fancy that this tragedy&mdash;beyond the
chances of military life&mdash;was her fault;
and that in the recklessness and despair of
his heart, Evan Cameron had risked his
life too rashly and lost it.
</p>

<p>
When this conviction came upon her,
tears streamed down her cheeks&mdash;hot salt
tears&mdash;which she made no effort to
restrain; and on suddenly discovering her
thus&mdash;after the departure of his guests,
Sir Harry Hurdell and Mr. Poole&mdash;Sir
Paget felt his soul stung with jealous fury.
</p>

<p>
He regarded her sternly rather than
lovingly, and puffed out his chest with
what he deemed an air of offended dignity.
Yet he attempted to take her hand.
</p>

<p>
'Do not touch me,' said Eveline, imploringly;
'at least not just&mdash;just now.'
</p>

<p>
'Upon my word, madam!  Do you
understand what your romantic pity for
this&mdash;this person implies?' he asked,
grimly, while polishing his bald head with
his handkerchief till it shone like a billiard
ball.
</p>

<p>
'He has no father or mother&mdash;no sister
to weep for him&mdash;none but myself to
sorrow for him.'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'And he died like a gentleman, upholding
the honour of Queen and country, and
the name of Cameron,' said Eveline, a little
defiantly.
</p>

<p>
'Bosh!  I suppose he was paid for all
that?  But enough of this.  May I ask,
have you no home interests and home ties
like other married women?'
</p>

<p>
Eveline made no reply; so, with a
violent jerk of his head, Sir Paget spoke
again.
</p>

<p>
'Listen to me, Lady Puddicombe.'
</p>

<p>
'I am doing so.'
</p>

<p>
'To me you seem like one of those
oddities or evil spirits one reads of only in
novels.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'Having had a romance in your life, or
fancying you had one, and believing you
have married the wrong man, and all that
sort of stuff, you like to live and brood on
a memory.  Is it so, Lady Puddicombe?
Answer me&mdash;did you actually love this
fellow Cameron?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' she replied, wincing, as he laid
his coarse hand rather roughly on her
delicate shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'Indeed.  And you love him still?'
</p>

<p>
'He is dead&mdash;he is dead&mdash;and perhaps
it is a sin to brood over the past.'
</p>

<p>
'An infernal futility, at all events.  All
this is pleasant for me, madam,' said he,
applying himself to polishing his pate
again.
</p>

<p>
A wiser man might have partly ignored
the affair, in the hope that it must in time
pass away; but her unmistakable emotion
of grief for Cameron's death proved
somewhat beyond the patience of Sir Paget,
who recurred to it warmly.
</p>

<p>
'His demise, if untimely, is very natural;
to face death and meet it was the trade he
chose, and for which the country paid him,
and well, too, as we shall find by next
year's income-tax.  What more would
you have?  Others quite as good as he&mdash;better
perhaps&mdash;have fallen in this grotesque
war, which, the Ministry tell us, is
no war at all, though it will be deuced
expensive work to us who have to stump-up
for it,' he continued, waving his hand
as he had done when addressing the same
words to his constituents at Slough-cum-Sloggit.
'Moreover, madam, we can only
die once, which is just as well.  Who is it
that likens the race of man to leaves on
the trees?'
</p>

<p>
'But the leaves fall in autumn, not as he
has done&mdash;my&mdash;my&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Love?' he suggested, with a gloomy sneer.
</p>

<p>
'No,' replied Eveline, quivering with
anger.
</p>

<p>
'What then, madam?'
</p>

<p>
'My dear friend&mdash;my brother's comrade,
and the saver of his life at Tel-el-Kebir.'
</p>

<p>
For some days the matter was not
referred to; Sir Paget sulked a good deal,
and dined often with his friend Hurdell at
the club, while Eveline, in her dumb grief,
felt like some piece of strange machinery
that must go through the evolutions for
which it was framed.
</p>

<p>
To Sir Paget she was an enraging
enigma.  Dead or alive, what was this
Highland fellow now to her?  But 'who,'
asks a writer, 'in middle age, when the
sordid cares of every-day life are
paramount, can comprehend the young heart's
passionate mystery&mdash;the love which, like
some bright tropical flower, buds and
blooms in a single day&mdash;the love which is
more than fancy!'
</p>

<p>
But a fresh impetus was given to Sir
Paget's jealous anger, and a keen edge put
upon it, when a letter addressed to 'Lady
Puddicombe' arrived one morning from
Messrs. Horning and Tailzie, W.S.,
Edinburgh, anent 'the will of the late Evan
Cameron, Esq., of Stratherroch,' informing
her that by that document, he had
bequeathed his estate of that name to her
and her heirs, whom, failing, to those of
his brother Duncan.  The letter then
proceeded to detail the encumbrances on the
estate, which was rapidly freeing itself;
that besides so much arable land there was
fine grouse-shooting, extending to about
eight thousand acres, yielding in favourable
seasons about nine hundred brace of
birds, besides black-game, snipe, ducks, and
plover; that there was excellent trout-fishing
in the river Erroch.  It then described
the mansion-house, stables, kennels,
and so forth, and wound up by asking for
'her ladyship's instructions.'
</p>

<p>
There was a postscript, saying that 'the
late Stratherroch seems to have been a
prime favourite with the crofters on the
estate, and they all deplore his untimely
end, even with tears.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, what does it all mean?' sighed
Eveline, in utter anguish and bewilderment.
The 'late'&mdash;how horrid&mdash;how awful
did that single word look, when she
recalled the yearning eyes, the farewell
glance of Evan Cameron, as he marched
past her on the departing day.
</p>

<p>
Transported with anger, Sir Paget
snatched the letter from her hand, and,
adjusting his gold <i>pince-nez</i> on his nose,
focussed the lines and glared at them;
and after he had read he tossed it from
him.
</p>

<p>
'An insult, by Jove, Lady Puddicombe&mdash;a
deliberate insult!'
</p>

<p>
'Sir Paget,' began Eveline, but paused;
she knew not what to urge or say, though
she knew but too well all the bequest
implied.
</p>

<p>
'Who wants his dirty acres of Highland
bog and rock?  Not I&mdash;the presumptuous
fellow!'
</p>

<p>
'Presumptuous!' repeated Eveline, with
a bitter smile, as she thought of the
antecedents of the baronet of Slough-cum-Sloggit.
'Cameron's descent is as old as
the hills; his ancestors have hunted with
James V., and in battle were the comrades
of Montrose and Dundee.'
</p>

<p>
'What the devil is all this to me&mdash;or to
<i>you</i>, for the matter of that?' snarled Sir
Paget, puffing out his chest.  'I am at
liberty to reject this bequest on my own
part.'
</p>

<p>
'But not on mine,' replied Eveline,
quietly yet firmly.
</p>

<p>
'The deuce&mdash;you will accept it?'
</p>

<p>
'Why should not I&mdash;if I do injustice to none?'
</p>

<p>
'And degrade yourself in the eyes of
the world!'
</p>

<p>
'How, Sir Paget?'
</p>

<p>
'What was this man to you? every man
will naturally inquire.'
</p>

<p>
'None can know that he was ever even
a friend to me,' said Eveline, with difficulty
restraining her tears.
</p>

<p>
'It must be rejected, I say!'
</p>

<p>
'But the estate is not left to you, Sir Paget.'
</p>

<p>
'Estate!' said he, scornfully.  'A few
acres of bog and heather, and a mansion
that probably keeps out neither wind nor
weather.'
</p>

<p>
So no action was taken in the matter
for a time, and the letter of Messrs. Horning
and Tailzie, W.S., remained unanswered,
much to the surprise of these
gentlemen (who deemed themselves
persons of no small importance), and was to
remain so until the return from
cub-hunting at Hurdell Hall.
</p>

<p>
Sir Paget was sorely ruffled by this new
event, and felt himself at liberty to sneer
vulgarly at Eveline's former lover, and at
her shattered fidelity to any vows she
made by her marriage with himself;
whereas the poor girl had never made
one.
</p>

<p>
She felt that&mdash;as a wedded wife&mdash;she
must stand alone in her secret grief, and
beyond the pale of human succour or
sympathy, and the sweet words of 'Auld
Robin Gray' occurred to her:
</p>

<p>
  'I daurna think o' Jamie, for that wad be a sin.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Times there were when she dreamt of
Evan vividly, and that he was with her
again.  'Why should it be a miracle that
the dead come back?' asks an author;
'the wonder is that they do not.  How
can one go away who loves you and never
return, nor speak, nor send any message&mdash;that
is the miracle; not that the heavens
should bend down and the gates of Paradise
roll back and those who have left us
return.'  At such times he seemed near to
her, and his voice was in her ears&mdash;more
near to her than he had ever been.  He
loved her, but he was gone&mdash;gone, and
the grey day was stealing slowly in!
</p>

<p>
Olive, she thought, she must see Olive;
doubtless Allan must have written home
to her, and his letters might contain some
details of this catastrophe that she would
learn nowhere else, so she contrived a visit
to Puddicombe Villa at Southsea on their
way to Hurdell Hall.  But she gained
nothing by this.
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie had heard of the late
event in Egypt, and saw in a moment how
it had affected her daughter.
</p>

<p>
'She is a very sensitive girl, Sir Paget,'
said she, deprecatingly, in reply to a
somewhat stinging remark of his; 'and
thus you see the sudden death of this
young man, so recently our guest at
Dundargue, and so long her brother's tried
friend and comrade, and one to whose
courage that brother and all of us owe so
much, has&mdash;not unnaturally, I think&mdash;greatly
shocked her.'
</p>

<p>
'Shocked her rather too much, apparently,'
jerked out Sir Paget, with a grimace.
'Who could have supposed that so brief
an acquaintance&mdash;shall we call it an
acquaintance?&mdash;could have produced an
impression so deep.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie bridled up a little and
crested her handsome head; for, like Sir
Paget, she had her own thoughts on the
subject.
</p>

<p>
'Well, he is gone now,' said she, after a
pause.
</p>

<p>
'And a devilish good thing, too,' added
Sir Paget, roughly.
</p>

<p>
She made no rejoinder, conceiving that
the less that was said on the matter the
better.
</p>

<p>
Eveline found Olive in a very crushed
state.
</p>

<p>
Allan had never written to her, and, as
yet, even his mother's letter of explanation
had not been replied to.  Perhaps he did
not believe in it.  He had left her abruptly
and passionately and with a sore heart.
Many such hearts are caught by others on
the rebound, for the void in them is more
easily filled up, and often requires to be so.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, heaven,' she thought, 'if such
should be the case with Allan&mdash;not in
Egypt, for that was very unlikely, but at
Gibraltar or Malta, where English ladies
were to be met with.'
</p>

<p>
'Even if married, I fear you would never
win the Dunmow Flitch,' Lady Aberfeldie
had said to her angrily on one occasion.
</p>

<p>
'My unfortunate money has been the
cause of all this,' replied Olive.  'It excited
the cunning and cupidity of that unfortunate
man, Holcroft, and has led to the
saddest misconceptions and misconstructions
from the first between dear Allan and
myself,' she added, in tears.
</p>

<p>
'Most true.'
</p>

<p>
Olive knew that the doubtful position in
which she had been placed with reference
to Allan had, as she thought, been fully
explained away in writing by his mother,
and his father too; but from Allan there
came no letter to herself.
</p>

<p>
What did his silence mean?  Even
anger were better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
'My unfortunate money,' she repeated:
'my golden chains have proved a curse to
us both.  He has ceased to love me now,
and, loving him as I do, what can my life
be to me?  And how shall I live on through
all the months and years of it without him?
What if we never meet again!  He may
fall in this war as his friend Cameron fell&mdash;oh,
my love&mdash;not you&mdash;not you&mdash;not <i>that</i>.'
</p>

<p>
And the luckless girl wept bitterly.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
A SKIRMISH IN THE DESERT.
</h3>

<p>
Buried in the sand!
</p>

<p>
Yes&mdash;it was all true&mdash;too true; the gay,
handsome, and usually light-hearted Laird
of Stratherroch, one of the most popular
fellows in the Black Watch&mdash;he who had
won the V.C. in battle with his good
claymore&mdash;he whom Eveline had known in the
heyday of his life, when the world seemed
so fresh and fair to both, whom she had
last seen as a despairing and broken-hearted
lover, was gone&mdash;struck down by
a bullet of some nameless Egyptian savage,
buried in the desert, and she would never
see him more, though the poignancy of his
farewell would haunt her for many a day.
</p>

<p>
And thus it all came to pass.
</p>

<p>
A band of Bedouins had been hovering
in the vicinity of Matarieh, plundering and
looting.  These Allan, after a consultation
with Cameron, resolved to make a
demonstration against, and with Farquharson,
his sergeant, and thirty picked men, in
light marching order, they quitted the
village, and about an hour before sunrise took
their way towards the desert.
</p>

<p>
The light of the coming day shone along
the latter, a sandy waste, overlooked by
Jebel Mokattam, a chain of rocks abrupt
and barren that extends from Cairo to the
cataracts.  They are generally flat, with
beetling summits, while below, on the
face which fronts the Nile, they are
furrowed as if water-worn by the rain of ages.
</p>

<p>
On the other flank, towards Jebel
Dimeshk, rises a ridge of sand-hills that
follows in the same direction at an equal
distance, all the windings and sinuosities
of that which lines the eastern bank.
</p>

<p>
Between lay the winding line of the
disused railway.  In front the horizon
seemed foggy or dusty, and along the
desert the sun shone for a time, as he
rose, like a red ball, shorn of his rays.
</p>

<p>
In rear the party left behind the village
of Matarieh, with the clumps of palm-trees,
beyond which, with the tall obelisk
and the ruins of several sphinxes, rose
the great mounds of earth that mark the
site of Heliopolis, 'the City of the Sun,'
the inhabitants of which worshipped a bull
called Mnevis, with the same ceremonies
as the Apis of Memphis, and where Apollo
had an oracle.
</p>

<p>
Over the same ground where in 1800 a
battle was fought between the French and
Turks, in which the latter were defeated
with the loss of eight thousand men and
all their cannon and baggage, Allan's little
band marched merrily on towards the
desert in hope to 'polish off' a few
of the Bedouins before returning to
quarters.
</p>

<p>
They were well supplied with ammunition;
each man had a day's rations in his
haversack, and his water-bottle filled with
the red sandy fluid of the Nile.  In
Exodus we are told that the Egyptians loathed
to drink the waters of that river, and, as
Cameron said, 'the men of the Black
Watch were much of the same mind.'
</p>

<p>
Now, in making a reconnaissance, Allan
Graham was a trained soldier enough to
know that cover from view is important,
as it enables troops, whatever their
strength, to form for action; thus he
hoped to utilise the railway bank, or, if
not that, some of the sandy undulations
around it.
</p>

<p>
As the first object in reconnoitring is
to get observation, with his sergeant, who
was a sharp fellow, he went at some
distance in front of his men, field-glass in
hand, and looked sharply about him.
</p>

<p>
He continued to move in a north-easterly
direction for nearly ten miles
till mid-day, but saw nothing of Bedouins,
and then, halting amid a clump of palms,
threw out some sentinels towards the
front, piled arms, and the Highlanders
in their kilts and red serges threw
themselves on the grass and prepared to make
a meal of what they had brought with
them, washed down by Nile water.
</p>

<p>
There he remained till noon was long
past, and he began to think of falling
back on Matarieh.
</p>

<p>
Even under the shadow of the palms
they were tormented by gnats and sandflies.
</p>

<p>
'We are in the land of the "Arabian
Nights"&mdash;the land of giants, fairies, and
genii, and all that sort of thing,' said
Cameron, as he lit a cigar; 'but, if a little
picturesque, Allan, the discomforts are
abominably real.'
</p>

<p>
'Surely water is lying yonder, sir,' said
Sergeant Farquharson, 'and we might get
our water-bottles filled.'
</p>

<p>
All looked eagerly in the direction
indicated, towards the base of the Jebel
Dimeshk range.  The sun was clear,
bright, and powerful now.  Amid the
silent waste of sand a long, narrow lake
seemed at no great distance.
</p>

<p>
'If water it is,' exclaimed Cameron,
'there are certainly men moving through it.'
</p>

<p>
'The Bedouins, by Jove!' cried Allan.
'Down, down,' he shouted to his sentinels,
'lie down, under cover if you can.'
</p>

<p>
They lay down flat, and Allan, adopting
the same position, turned his field-glass
towards the mirage, for such it was&mdash;that
beautiful optical illusion produced by the
sun's rays reflected from the heated sand,
and which raises before the eye of the
thirsty wayfarer the tantalising but perfect
representation of distant lakes or pleasing
sheets of water.
</p>

<p>
About eighty Bedouin horse were moving
slowly from the direction of the Jebel
Dimeskh range towards the line of the
railway.  Whatever their object was, from
a description given to Allan, he was
certain they were those of whom he was in
search, and that their object was to turn
up in the vicinity of Matarieh after sunset,
intent on plunder, as everywhere these
lawless sons of the desert were taking
advantage of the confusion of affairs in
Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Some were armed with long muskets of
antique form, but by far the greater
number had Remington rifles&mdash;flung away by
Arabi's fugitive soldiers&mdash;slung over their
backs, or at their saddles, weapons that
had superseded the javelin, the bow, and
in many instances the spear.  They were
clad in barracans of dark brown wool, with
floating burnouses, many of them spotlessly
white; and as they seemed to be making
slowly, for shelter doubtless, towards the
clump of palms occupied by Allan's party,
which was yet beyond their range of vision,
he drew the whole off and took post behind
the bank of the abandoned railway, a
movement which was fortunately quite unseen
by the foe.
</p>

<p>
Formation against cavalry would be
useless, as these wild horsemen have no idea
of tactics; and, to deceive them as to his
force, Allan formed his men in extended
order, three paces apart, each man lying
on his face, close under the line of the
embankment.
</p>

<p>
Allan knew from experience how fire
from a steep slope becomes plunging;
thus he congratulated himself that the
slope for his musketry was one that was
parallel to the trajectory of the rifles.
</p>

<p>
By a single word he could, if necessary,
form his men in a rallying square on the
crest of the line.  As the Bedouins came
riding forward, in a disorderly group, at
an easy, ambling pace, Allan, by means of
his field-glass, was certain that in their
leader he recognised the Arab, Zeid-el-Ourdeh,
whom he had succoured after his
wounds at Kassassin, and sent to the
hospital at Ismailia.
</p>

<p>
He was wearing the same robes with
wide sleeves, and the richly embroidered
girdle he wore when found near the camp.
</p>

<p>
'Steady and still, men,' cried Allan,
'and we'll play old gooseberry with these
beggars, as we have done everywhere
else.'
</p>

<p>
They were about five hundred paces
distant, a range for which the rifles were
sighted, when suddenly a Bedouin uttered
a shrill cry of alarm, and all began to
unsling their firearms.  His eye had detected
a clay-coloured helmet with its red hackle
on the left side.
</p>

<p>
Ere they could fire a shot, the
Highlanders from their cover poured in a
deadly fire, and more than twenty men
and horses went down in confused heaps;
the latter, in the agony of their wounds
and terror, kicking and lashing wildly out
with their hoofs, raising clouds of sand,
while braining the skulls and breaking the
limbs of the fallen riders, whether dead or
wounded; then shrieks and groans, cries
and curses loaded the air, as all who were
untouched or able to keep their saddles,
after firing, half at random, a ragged
volley, wheeled round their light chargers
and went off with the speed of the wind.
</p>

<p>
'Cease firing!' cried Allan Graham;
'we have taught these fellows a lesson
severe enough for the day, and I don't
think they will venture near Matarieh
again.'
</p>

<p>
In that, however, he was mistaken, as
he afterwards found to his cost.
</p>

<p>
'And now,' he added, as he crossed
the line of railway, sword in hand, 'to
give water to the wounded, succour any
we can, smash all their weapons, and leave
them to fate or their returning friends.'
</p>

<p>
He, with most of his party, approached
the place where the victims of the fusilade
lay, and, so far as blood, wounds, and
agony went, they presented a very dreadful
scene, and yet a trifling one when
compared with that witnessed so lately in the
trenches of Tel-el-Kebir.
</p>

<p>
Many were shot outright; others,
severely wounded, lay wallowing and choking
in their blood, and they regarded the
victors with a firm, scowling, and defiant
expression in their long, thin, tawny faces,
and black, bright, glittering eyes, that
made them look, as Allan said, like dying
eagles.
</p>

<p>
But, before anything could be done for
the survivors, the fatal episode of the day
took place.
</p>

<p>
A little way apart from the group of
death and agony, lay a Bedouin, who,
though untouched, was partly under his
horse, from which he freed himself, and
then Cameron advanced to take him
prisoner.  He was an athletic and gigantic
fellow, all bone and sinew, lithe as
a serpent, and active as the antelope of
his native deserts.
</p>

<p>
Drawing a long pistol from his girdle,
he levelled it at Cameron, but it snapped,
on which he flung it furiously at the head
of the latter, who ducked, and escaped it.
</p>

<p>
Several Highlanders now rushed forward,
as he had drawn a large and heavy
Damascus sabre, but they paused with
their hands on their locks when Cameron
cried,
</p>

<p>
'Stand back, my lads, and leave him
to me!'  And in a moment both their
blades were flashing in the setting sun,
for Cameron fell upon him claymore in
hand.
</p>

<p>
'May your head be covered by a whirlwind
of fire!' hissed the Bedouin in Arabic,
through his clenched teeth, while he hewed
away without the least intention of
surrendering.  The hood of his red and white
striped burnous had fallen back, and his
whole head and face, with flashing eyes and
gleaming teeth, were displayed to view.
</p>

<p>
Cameron was a skilful swordsman, but
so was the Bedouin, who was his superior
in height and muscular power.  Their
blades struck red sparks from each other.
Cameron forgot to draw his long dirk:
but he had 'Sir Garnet's' ugly jack-knife
in his left hand, for parrying purposes.
How the combat would have terminated,
it is difficult to say, but a vile Bedouin,
who lay wounded close by, armed with a
long, straight sword, with the last effort
of expiring nature, writhed himself up
from the sand, ran poor Cameron through
the body from behind, and fell back dead.
</p>

<p>
With a hollow groan, Cameron fell
backward across him, and was about to
receive a finishing stroke from his
antagonist, when the latter was shot through
the head by Sergeant Farquharson.
</p>

<p>
This catastrophe rather cooled Allan's
humane ideas of succouring the wounded.
Very few of the Highlanders had been
touched, and these but slightly.
However, it seemed as if Cameron was dying.
He was speechless, and his mouth at
times was filled with blood.  It was
impossible then to ascertain the exact nature
of his wounds, or what part of the body
was injured.  Allan, full of tenderness,
anxiety, and the deepest commiseration,
formed a pad of his handkerchief, and,
using his sash as a bandage, endeavoured,
so far as in him lay, to stop the bleeding,
while a litter was improvised by a couple
of rifles, with a blanket stretched over
them; and the party began to fall back
on Matarieh, but often had to halt, for
the agony of Cameron was great, and
Allan began to despair of getting him
conveyed in life to Matarieh, which, as
we have said, was nearly ten miles distant,
while, to enhance their difficulties, a troop
of nearly a hundred Bedouins were visible,
pouring down a rocky gorge of the Jebel
Mokattam range; so nothing was left to
Allan but to continue his retreat, which
they seemed slow or disinclined to follow up.
</p>

<p>
Yet their presence was fraught with
danger, especially after the sun, with its
usual rapidity in these regions, went down
like a red, fiery ball, and the lurid haze
exhaled from the flat desert on which the
darkness fell.
</p>

<p>
The stars were coming out in the blue
zenith; the dew was already beginning to
fall; long and dark shadows lay across the
plain, but the line of the railway was a sure
guide back to Matarieh and the vicinity of
Heliopolis.
</p>

<p>
Every step of his bearers elicited a moan
of pain from Cameron, and these went to
the heart of his friend as if they had been
the utterances of a brother, while now and
then the sufferer muttered his thanks to
the soldiers for their care and kindness,
and his regret for the trouble he gave
them after a day of toil, and his fears that
he was retarding their retreat and thereby
involving them in danger.  Of his own
pain or peril he never uttered a word.
</p>

<p>
Constellations new to him and his
comrades were in the sky now&mdash;a vast blue
dome that stretched far, far away, all
bright with glorious stars.
</p>

<p>
At last it was absolutely necessary to
halt for a time, for all thought the sufferer
was dying, and the Highlanders said that
if the Bedouins came on again they would
form square round him; and soon it
became too evident that Evan Cameron was
lying 'on the bleak neutral ground between
life and death.'
</p>

<p>
Accustomed though they were to suffering
and slaughter, the Highlanders stood
around him leaning on their muskets, full
of commiseration, and looking attentively
at the pale face of the dying officer
and back to the desert where they had last
seen the enemy hovering; and more than
one wished that the Bedouins would only
come on again.
</p>

<p>
'Has no man among us here any water?'
asked Allan, for by this time the tin bottles
of the detachment were empty.
</p>

<p>
A man who was in the act of taking
the stopper out of his, paused instantly.
</p>

<p>
'Captain Graham, here is mine,' said
he; 'there are only a drop or two left, but
if it was my blood I'd give it for Evan
Cameron,' he added, emphatically, with
that familiarity which is peculiar to the
Highlander, and has no rudeness in it.
</p>

<p>
'Donald, thank you,' said Allan.
</p>

<p>
'My mother bides nigh the braes of
Stratherroch, and I am not likely to forget
that to-night,' said the soldier, with a
break in his voice.
</p>

<p>
Raising Cameron's head gently, Allan
put Donald's water-bottle to his lips, and
he drank thirstily of the fetid and odious
water it contained, 'the Nile soup,' as our
men called it.
</p>

<p>
Refreshed even by it for a few minutes,
Evan Cameron spoke to Allan, but in
whispers, and, as they seemed to be
meant for the ear of the latter alone, the
soldiers with one accord drew back a little
way.
</p>

<p>
'I knew from the first that I should
never pull through&mdash;nor do I wish to do
so, Allan,' said he, speaking at long
intervals and with a husky effort.
</p>

<p>
'We have faced death together in
many ways, but I wish your case had been
mine, Evan, even if it is to be a fatal
one.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't say that, Allan, dear fellow,'
replied Evan, with that strange, far-off
expression of eye which belongs alone to
a fast-ebbing life&mdash;an expression which
Allan could see even in the starlight as he
stooped close over the sufferer, 'my sight
is failing me, yet I can in fancy see
Eveline&mdash;oh! so distinctly, Allan&mdash;and I seem
to hear her voice&mdash;you don't mind me
saying this now, lying, as I am here, face to
face with God&mdash;the voice that seemed to
whisper to my heart.'
</p>

<p>
Allan could only press the clammy hand
that never again would grasp the broad
claymore.  Evan spoke again, but still
more brokenly,
</p>

<p>
'I am not jealous now of my married
rival; I only sorrow for the lost future of
Eveline; married to an old man whom she
may respect but never love, and with whom
she cannot have a sympathy in common.'
</p>

<p>
'You are talking too much, Evan.'
</p>

<p>
'And thinking of her rather than my
prayers.  When I am lying here in my
long and peaceful sleep, far from my
father's grave in bonnie Stratherroch, she
will live all the years of a young life, and,
in the time to come, will&mdash;of course,
forget me.'
</p>

<p>
His voice was almost gone now, yet
his eyes dilated when Allan said, with
sorrowful emphasis,
</p>

<p>
'Evan, she will never forget you.'
</p>

<p>
'Nearer me&mdash;come nearer, Allan; I&mdash;I
want you to tell her&mdash;tell her&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
What he was to tell Allan never heard,
as the voice of Cameron ceased; a change,
perceptible in the clear starlight, was
passing over his face; a dew was gathering
on his forehead, and dark shadows
under his eyes.
</p>

<p>
'He's gone, sir,' said Sergeant
Farquharson, lifting his helmet for a moment
in mute reverence.  'Well, Captain
Graham, the golden gates have never closed
upon a better officer or a braver man!
Poor Evan Cameron,' he added, stooping
over the body and looking at it earnestly.
</p>

<p>
Allan cast a long and sad glance at it
too; then he laid a hand on the heart; it
might be only syncope&mdash;no, it did not
seem to be that.
</p>

<p>
The profile of his face in its stillness
looked like a classic cameo cut in high
relief.  His fair, almost golden, hair,
clipped close with military precision,
retained still its crispy ripple.  The brown
moustache shading the short upper lip
had been somewhat untrimmed of late;
but he looked so life-like that Allan
almost shuddered as he spread the
blanket over him and covered him up&mdash;for
he felt that in that wretched substitute
for a shroud lay one whom he knew his
sister&mdash;married albeit as she was to
another&mdash;loved better than life!
</p>

<p>
It was hard to think of so young and
gallant a life being cut short thus by
the inexorable scissors of Fate; but he
was gone to the 'Land of the leal,' where
there can be no sorrow nor thought of
sordid things.
</p>

<p>
'We cannot leave him lying here thus;
neither can we carry him off; while there
is a chance of these Bedouin devils coming
on again.  Besides, there are always jackals
about,' said Allan, as he took possession of
Evan's claymore, dirk, and ring.  'Scoop
a hole&mdash;a temporary grave in the sand&mdash;and
cover him up, till we can return by
daylight, and bring him into quarters for
proper interment.'
</p>

<p>
The soldiers, with their hands, bayonets,
and rifle-butts, hollowed a trench some
three feet deep, and therein, rolled in a
blanket, they reverently deposited the yet
warm form of Cameron, and covered it
up with sand.
</p>

<p>
Allan maintained a grim silence, and,
though his heart was full of genuine grief,
the remarks of his soldiers pleased him.
</p>

<p>
'Those who have lived with us and died
as he has done will never be forgotten
in the regiment, sir,' said Sergeant
Farquharson.
</p>

<p>
'Mourn for the mourner, I have heard
my mother say in Gaelic, and not for the
dead, as they are at rest and we in tears,'
said Donald, as he hooked-on his water-bottle.
</p>

<p>
'He has none to mourn for him now
but one, and she is far away,' remarked
Allan, with a swelling in his throat.  'And
now fall in, lads.'
</p>

<p>
The Highlanders marched on their way
back to Matarieh in silence, impressed by
the recent episode; for, if gallant and
reckless fellows in battle, they were
thoughtful and full of sorrow for the
brave young officer they had lost.
</p>

<p>
A shot or two, fired apparently at
random in the distance, sparkling out redly
amid the obscurity, showed that the
Bedouins were following them up, and must
have passed over the very place where
Cameron lay.
</p>

<p>
The silence of the starry night was
upon the world then&mdash;upon the ridgy
summits of Jebel Mokattam, and
darkness now enfolded the desert where Evan
Cameron lay in such awful loneliness,
without even the grim companionship of
the dead&mdash;the last Cameron of the old
fighting line of Stratherroch.
</p>

<p>
Two days after, with an ambulance
waggon, Sergeant Farquharson, and some
of his men, Allan went along the line of
the old railway from Matarieh to the place
where they had left the body&mdash;a place
marked in their memory by the presence
of two large stones and some shrubs near
the embankment&mdash;but of these they could
find no trace, though they searched for
hours, believing they might have passed
them or miscalculated the distance.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was to be seen about the real
or supposed spot but sand, smooth and
drifted sand everywhere.  Thus Allan
could but come to the sorrowful conclusion
that some species of sand-storm must
have swept from the desert south-eastward
between the mountain ranges, and buried
every trace of the hastily-made grave.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
HURDELL HALL.
</h3>

<p>
'Welcome to Hurdell Hall!  My sister
Lucretia&mdash;Lady Puddicombe and Sir Paget,
Lucretia&mdash;Sir Paget, our mutual friend
Poole, you know.'
</p>

<p>
Thus did Sir Harry Hurdell introduce
Eveline and Sir Paget, with much
<i>empressement</i> and effusiveness, to his home in
Hampshire, when the carriage duly
deposited them, with Mademoiselle Clairette,
Sir Paget's valet, and 'no end' of trunks
and boxes in a van, at the porte cochère.
</p>

<p>
Situated in the northern district of the
shire, where the woods are chiefly hazel,
birch, alder, and willow, where flocks of
deer scour the coppice, Hurdell Hall is a
fine example of the old Tudor architecture,
and, as Eveline saw it for the first
time with the rays of the evening sun
casting dashes of golden light upon its
ogee gables, mullioned bay-windows, its
long gravelled approach, and stately
terrace, she thought what a charming picture
it would make, with its background of
oaks, which in Hampshire seldom rise into
lofty stems, but have branches that are
usually twisted into picturesque outlines.
</p>

<p>
Below the terrace lay a kind of pool, in
which a couple of swans were floating
lazily, each with one leg tucked up under
a wing, and where the snow-white
water-lilies gleamed in the sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Nor was the inside of the Hall&mdash;which
was to be associated with events never
to be forgotten by Eveline&mdash;any way
inferior to the outside.  There were
stately apartments furnished with every
modern luxury in the way of upholstery,
and others where the furniture spoke of
an old, old past, and of generations
of Hurdells who had long since been
gathered together in the old family vault;
panelled corridors adorned with busts of
Roman emperors and gods; stuffed tropical
birds and horns of gigantic size; cabinets,
swords, daggers, helmets, and armour;
and where portraits were hung of knights
and dames in brilliant colours; one of Sir
Harry, who accompanied the Royal Bluebeard
to the field of cloth of gold; another
who had been the comrade of Sir Horace
of Tilbury in many a field in Flanders;
and the Hurdells of later times in
powdered wigs, toupees, and long stomachers.
</p>

<p>
There was also a charming little Gothic
private chapel, which had now a luxurious
divan around it, as the present Sir Harry,
not being much addicted to devotions, had
turned it into a billiard-room, and a most
commodious and excellent one it was, as
the niches were tall enough to hold cues
and the basin of the font was admirably
calculated to hold the balls.
</p>

<p>
Sir Harry was rather handsome, but
<i>blasé</i> in aspect and bearing; there was an
indolent and rather lascivious expression
in his eyes, the light colour of which it is
difficult to define; he had a transparent
nostril and short upper lip, with long
tawny moustache, and a face which, though
difficult to say why, was not a pleasing
one.
</p>

<p>
His sister Lucretia, his senior by several
years, was somewhat his counterpart in
appearance, and, nearer her fortieth than
her thirtieth year, was still very
handsome, but handsome in a faded way;
and she received the young wife of old
Sir Paget with considerable effusiveness,
kissing her on both cheeks <i>à la Francaise</i>;
though Eveline, fair, soft, and timid even
in friendship, felt oppressed rather than
soothed or pleased by the society of this
somewhat <i>blasé</i> and disappointed woman
of the world, with her cold, steely eyes,
ashy-tinted hair, thin lips, and caressing
manner; and Eveline soon discovered she
was vain, shallow, selfish, and not
unaddicted to white lies when they suited
her purpose.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the creature she cared most
for in this world, after herself and her
brother, was a little, wheezy 'King
Charles,' with a blue ribbon and silver
bell adorning its neck.
</p>

<p>
While the gentlemen were smoking and
idling in the billiard-room&mdash;the same place
where Philip of Spain, <i>en route</i> from
Southampton to marry Mary, had made his
devotions&mdash;she entertained Eveline with
afternoon tea in a charming little room
dark with oak-panelling, with rare old oak
furniture, and hangings of ancient tapestry
that testified to the industry of white-handed
Hurdells in generations past.
</p>

<p>
Something of <i>ennui</i>, at least, in the
young face of her new acquaintance did
not fail to catch the attention of the sharp
Lucretia, who knew from the first that
Eveline's marriage had been an ill-assorted
one; yet, she said, after a pause,
</p>

<p>
'You long to join the gentlemen, I
think; they are not far off&mdash;only at the
end of the corridor.'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, I am more pleased to be
with you.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, dear; but I fear that you and
Sir Paget are a pair of regular love-birds,
and must go through a systematic amount
of billing and cooing every day.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline smiled faintly, but made no
response.  Did Miss Hurdell mean this
as a sneer? she thought; it seemed so.
</p>

<p>
'Dear Sir Paget!' said Miss Hurdell
again, a little irrelevantly.  'I thought
love-matches were out of fashion now.'
</p>

<p>
'She <i>is</i> mocking me,' thought Eveline,
yet the rather aristocratic face of Lucretia
was as inscrutable as her manner was
suave to sweetness.
</p>

<p>
'All who know Sir Paget respect him&mdash;he
is a thoroughly good man,' said
Eveline, feeling the necessity of saying
something.
</p>

<p>
'"Women always like wicked fellows,"
says Lefanu, in one of his novels.  It is
contrast; but it has been my experience
that they do.'
</p>

<p>
'No right-minded woman would endorse
this opinion of our sex, I am assured.'
</p>

<p>
Miss Hurdell laughed at Eveline's
gravity, and refilled their cups of
dragon-blue china.
</p>

<p>
'I always hated the idea of being
married,' said she.
</p>

<p>
'Why?' asked Eveline.
</p>

<p>
'Because it would make life&mdash;I
thought&mdash;so tame.'
</p>

<p>
'How odd!'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, no doubt you think so.  I didn't
care about being engaged and all that sort
of thing; but no, I never would have
married.'
</p>

<p>
Sooth to say, she had never had an
offer, or been engaged, in her life.
</p>

<p>
'It is so nice to be a <i>fiancée</i>&mdash;the object
of daily attention.'
</p>

<p>
'Then you must have been engaged to
know all this, Miss Hurdell.'
</p>

<p>
'Like yourself, dear, of course&mdash;but call
me Lucretia.  A girl has more freedom
when engaged than before it; though the
envy of her female friends, she can be
more natural with her gentlemen friends,
and may say many a merry and rantipole
thing she dared not have said before.
Goldsmith was right when he makes
Dr. Primrose declare that courtship is
generally a happier state than marriage.  To
me it seems to turn the butterfly into a
caterpillar.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline knew what to think of these
novel views, but she sighed as she thought
of what her own existence was now.
</p>

<p>
'To me,' resumed the fair Lucretia, 'it
always seemed as if, when the wedding-ring
was slipped on my slender finger, I
should have nothing left to live for; that
my existence would belong wholly to
another person.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline set down her tea-cup and looked
at the speaker with something of mute
wonder.  In society she had met with many
strange persons, but none who had such odd
views as the mature chatelaine of Hurdell
Hall.
</p>

<p>
'But you would have your husband to
live for,' she urged gently, but certainly
not thinking of her <i>own</i>.
</p>

<p>
'A very commonplace style of living, I
should think.'
</p>

<p>
'Not if one marries for love,' said
Eveline softly.
</p>

<p>
'As you married' (old was on her lips)
'as you married dear Sir Paget.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline felt her colour rise, yet she only
said, 'But&mdash;but to marry with any doubt
in one's heart would be deception.'
</p>

<p>
'Well,' said Miss Hurdell, raising her
eyebrows, 'if a woman may not deceive
her own husband whom has she a right to
deceive?'
</p>

<p>
This was a new view of the matter to
poor Eveline, who began to have rather a
horror of her hostess.
</p>

<p>
'There goes the dressing-bell, dear&mdash;we
dine at eight,' said Lucretia, rising; 'let
me conduct you to your room.'
</p>

<p>
Once there, Eveline was free to give full
vent to her own thoughts.  She would
never see that lonely grave in the desert
where Evan Cameron lay; but to her
mind it was sacred, as of old was the place
whereon the angel of the Lord alighted.
</p>

<p>
'Oh for some news&mdash;news of how it all
came about!  If Allan would only write to
me&mdash;or to Olive; he surely will tell her.
This is more than I can bear!' and
interlacing her slender white fingers&mdash;a way
she had contracted now when alone&mdash;she
pressed them with palms outward, against
her throbbing forehead, as if she meant to
break them.
</p>

<p>
Alas! she was to learn too soon tidings
of another dire calamity, and <i>why</i> Allan
was unable to write to any one.
</p>

<p>
There was no trace of all this deep
emotion in her soft face when she
descended to the drawing-room, with a
velvet dress of that blue which so suited
her pale complexion, cut square at the neck,
and having elbow sleeves with lace, and
rich mosaics set in gold clasping her
white neck, and exquisitely rounded arms
that were so white and taper.
</p>

<p>
There could be no two opinions about
her rare beauty, and Sir Harry Hurdell
and his fast friend&mdash;fast in more ways
than one&mdash;both acknowledged it at a
glance, as their sharp and critical eyes
took in every detail of her witching face,
her rounded girlish cheek, her sweetly
curved mouth, with its short upper lip, her
nose and delicate nostrils.
</p>

<p>
Sir Harry Hurdell was very sceptical
of the purity of all women.  He would
not have believed in that of his own
mother had she been alive; so he was
perhaps to be pardoned for deeming that
Lady Puddicombe 'was just like the rest,'
whatever that might mean.
</p>

<p>
He was intensely gratified and glad that
the girl was so young and lovely, and that
her husband was so old and so common-place:
thus he resolved, in his own phraseology,
'to enter stakes for the filly&mdash;to
make his innings if he could, or the devil
was in it!'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
SIR HARRY.
</h3>

<p>
There was an air of lassitude, of settled
melancholy, and at times of abstraction,
apparent about Eveline, which she could
not always successfully conceal, that did
not fail to impress and surprise the baronet
of Hurdell Hall and his sister, and the
latter observed her narrowly when they
were together in the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
'I have heard that you sing beautifully,
Lady Puddicombe,' said she, opening the
piano.
</p>

<p>
'I used to sing&mdash;a little,' replied Eveline.
</p>

<p>
'Used to sing!  Why drop so charming
an accomplishment?'
</p>

<p>
'I have had thoughts of late that make
me sad.'
</p>

<p>
'We must cure you of all that.  What
style of music do you love most?'
</p>

<p>
'I love all music that is beautiful.'
</p>

<p>
'And songs?'
</p>

<p>
'That are melancholy.'
</p>

<p>
'Then sing me some favourite thing
before the gentlemen join us&mdash;there is a
dear, do.'
</p>

<p>
Thus urged, and fearing to appear
ungracious, Eveline seated herself before the
instrument&mdash;a grand and very stately one
it was, and began to sing in a voice that
became tender, passionate, and beautiful,
touching; even the somewhat arid heart of
her listener&mdash;by two of the verses especially:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Perchance, if we had never met,<br />
  I had been spared this mad regret,<br />
  This endless striving to forget,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever and for ever!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ah me, I cannot bear the pain,<br />
  Of never seeing thee again,<br />
  I cling to thee with might and main,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever and for ever!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She felt as if she were singing to Evan,
who, perhaps, in spirit was hovering near
her; for Eveline was beginning at times
to have strange fancies now.  There were
tears in her voice as she sang, and there
were tears in her eyes too; but she paused
abruptly as the gentlemen came in from
the dining-room, and the eyes of Sir Paget
were fixed inquiringly and reprovingly
upon her.  Her voice seemed to pass
away, nor could any entreaties of Sir
Harry and his sister make her conclude the
song&mdash;a well-known one.
</p>

<p>
'Hah&mdash;thereby hangs a tale!' thought
the fair Lucretia, as Sir Harry conducted
Eveline back to her chair, and took a seat
by her side.
</p>

<p>
No idle or constitutionally dissipated
man can withstand the temptation of
attempting to fascinate a pretty woman, and,
if possible, of eclipsing another man, and
to eclipse one like old Sir Paget would
seem no very difficult task; so, while
talking quietly with Eveline on the last play,
the last news, or any current subject, Sir
Harry was thinking to himself, while
admiring the contour of her head, her rich
brown hair, long eyelashes, and lovely
little hands,
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, if old Pudd would only go off
the hooks, anyhow!  She can't care a
straw for him, don't you know, with his
old bald pate that he is always jerking
forward like a hen when she has laid an
egg.  She was in love with some fellow
who has gone to Egypt&mdash;so Holcroft told
me&mdash;been engaged to him perhaps; but
her mother was set upon her marrying old
Pudd's coin, and among them all they
talked her into it, no doubt.  Poor little
girl, I must try to console her.'
</p>

<p>
Lucretia Hurdell, who at times affected
girlish airs, now brought that piece of
drawing-room foolery, her 'Confession
Book,' upon the <i>tapis</i>.
</p>

<p>
'You must positively write me yours,
dear Lady Puddicombe,' said she.
</p>

<p>
'Or permit me to write there for you,'
suggested Sir Harry.  'Now to begin&mdash;"Were
you ever in love?"'
</p>

<p>
'The idea of asking a married woman
that,' exclaimed Miss Hurdell.
</p>

<p>
'If so, how often?' continued her brother.
</p>

<p>
'I would say "never," according to the
novelist's idea of it,' replied Eveline, with
an air of annoyance.
</p>

<p>
'Don't know what that idea is,' said Sir
Henry, eyeing her askance and admiringly.
</p>

<p>
'I should rather say I have been in
love, but never mean to be so again.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline shivered as she said this, for
while conversing apparently with Mr. Pyke
Poole the cold eyes of Sir Paget were
upon her again.
</p>

<p>
She felt the rashness of her speech.  It
was offensive to him, and was not without
some point in the mind of Sir Harry.
</p>

<p>
The cub-hunting was not to begin for a
few days yet, and meanwhile the master of
the house followed her about pretty
persistently, so that she had, ere long, a
restless feeling about it.  When departing on
a riding-party he anticipated Sir Paget by
swinging her into the saddle, adjusting
her skirts and reins, leaving Pike Poole to
do that office for Miss Hurdell, to whom,
in return for pleasant quarters, he usually
devoted himself, while she, with all her
alleged indifference to matrimony, was not
indisposed to receive his attentions.
</p>

<p>
There was something in the occasional
gaze of Sir Harry that puzzled the
innocent Eveline and made her feel restless
under it, especially when he hung over her
at the piano, as he constantly did; and now
she played more than she cared for, to
avoid conversation and have freedom to
indulge in her own sad thoughts.
</p>

<p>
'Surely you must be tired of standing
there so long, Sir Harry,' she said once,
with surprise.
</p>

<p>
'Tired of what&mdash;listening to you or
gazing on you?' he replied, lowering his
voice for her ear alone; 'either were
impossible.'
</p>

<p>
If he had been addressing a barmaid he
could scarcely have made a more pointed
remark; but so full was Eveline of
thoughts too deep for words&mdash;thoughts of
the untimely fate of one who loved her so
dearly&mdash;to whose fate or past existence
she dared not refer, and for whom she
dared not wear even a black ribbon&mdash;that
she did not perceive the admiration she
was exciting in the breast of Sir Harry
and in the quiet purity of her own heart
that such sentiments as his could exist,
never occurred to her.
</p>

<p>
He ventured on one occasion to say
something very pointed about the beauty
of her hands as she idled over the piano
keys.
</p>

<p>
'As there are other ladies in the room,
I cannot compliment you on your
discrimination, Sir Harry,' she replied, coldly.
'But what do you mean by saying such
things to me?' she added.
</p>

<p>
She began at last to perceive that there
was a meaning in his voice.  She felt
offended, and wished the cub-hunting would
begin, that the visit of herself and Sir
Paget to Hurdell Hall might come the sooner
to an end.
</p>

<p>
'If I could only achieve a good long
and quiet walk and talk with her,'
grumbled Sir Harry to himself; 'but in this
cursed place we are always interrupted&mdash;can't
attempt to make my innings or be
with her alone.  Lucretia, Poole, or
some one else always turns up, and
she&mdash;herself&mdash;never gives a fellow the chance
wanted.'
</p>

<p>
Though innately wicked in heart and
rejoicing that the poor girl had made&mdash;or
been compelled by others to make&mdash;an
ill-assorted marriage, something of
pity for her began to mingle with his
nefarious ideas and hopes, and that pity
was as much akin to love as his <i>blasé</i> soul
could feel.
</p>

<p>
'It is a regular case of Beauty and the
Beast, this marriage of old Pudd's,'
thought he.
</p>

<p>
Finding her promenading on the terrace
alone one evening overlooking the pool
where the swans swam among the
snow-white water-lilies, he hastened to
join her.
</p>

<p>
'I don't think you have seen our
conservatories,' he said.  'Permit me to show
you them.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, I do so love flowers.'
</p>

<p>
They entered the long glazed avenues
of potted plants and rich exotics, where
rustic sofas with luxurious cushions were
placed under the feathery foliage of
acacias, and after idling a little, admiring
flowers that were of great beauty and the
perfection of professional gardening, Sir
Harry brought her a tiny bouquet of
beautiful and sweetly-scented violets,
which, thoughtlessly, she placed in the
bosom of her dress.
</p>

<p>
His eyes gleamed as he saw her do this.
He said,
</p>

<p>
'So charmed to see the place assigned
to my gift.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'When I know what the flower imports
in the language of flowers.'
</p>

<p>
'What does the violet import?' asked
Eveline, shortly.
</p>

<p>
'Is it possible you do not know?'
</p>

<p>
'I do not.'
</p>

<p>
'It means eternal love and constancy.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed,' responded Eveline, with a tone
of indifference.  She felt inclined to
detach the bouquet from her dress, and
restore it to the giver or deposit it on one
of the iron shelves, but as that might have
implied that she understood too much, she
simply quitted the conservatory and went
once more upon the terrace.
</p>

<p>
'The air is chilly here after the hot atmosphere
of the conservatories,' said Sir Harry,
greatly encouraged by the acceptance of
his flowers; 'and that Shetland shawl is
only an apology for a wrap over your
head, though you look charming in
it&mdash;permit me,' he added, as he drew it closer
round her.
</p>

<p>
Their eyes met as he did so, and she
read an expression in his downward gaze
that made her pale cheek crimson, and
then grow pale again; and to avoid
anything more she re-entered the house.
</p>

<p>
'It is because I am married to an old
man that he dares to treat me thus, and so
thinks little of me,' she began to reflect&mdash;'an
old man whose eyes are ever full of
angry reproach about poor Evan, who
never wronged him, even in thought.  Oh,
how hateful, how loathsome my life is!  If
luxurious it is duplicity, all!'
</p>

<p>
She actually began to think she would
go away somewhere&mdash;where her father
and husband would never find her&mdash;change
her name and be a governess or something
of that kind.  The idea of suicide or
anything so dreadful, in all her sorrow,
bitterness, and humiliation of spirit, never
occurred to her for a moment.  She only
hoped that God would direct her, pardon
her for these rebellious feelings against
fate, and let her live her own way and
then die.
</p>

<p>
Why did she not run away before her
absurd marriage? she thought now, and
before her young life was so utterly
wrecked by it?  But she forgot how,
under the motherly care and authority of
Lady Aberfeldie, she had always been in a
certain constraint and awe, and how her
own sudden jealousy of Evan Cameron had
helped to bring that catastrophe about.
</p>

<p>
But this growing admiration on the part
of Sir Harry Hurdell was a new experience
in life to her.
</p>

<p>
She was justly incensed by it, and knew
that he was presuming upon her youth,
her husband's age, and the too apparent
aspect of an ill-assorted marriage.  Their
visit must be cut short at all risks; but
what excuse was she to make to Sir Paget;
for, with her knowledge of his jealousy of
one who was dead, how was she to
enlighten him on the subject of Sir Harry,
whose manner proved to her somewhat
obnoxious.
</p>

<p>
The truth was that he was so much in
the use and wont of having 'sherry-glass
flirtations' at railway buffets, and so forth,
that he was quite incapable of showing his
admiration or regard in a subtle or
pleasing, respectful or cavalier way, and even
his own grooms might have been better
hands at it than he, the lord of that grand
old ancestral home.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
THE CUB-HUNTING.
</h3>

<p>
The gong for breakfast sounded betimes
at Hurdell Hall on the morning of the
first day's cub-hunting, as an early hour is
always most favourable for scent, and, as
several guests were invited, an ample meal
was spread in the great dining-room, the
several bay windows of which overlooked
the terrace and stately chase that spread
far away beyond it.
</p>

<p>
Sir Harry and his sister were the first
who appeared, and the latter looked round
for the morning papers, but could see
none.
</p>

<p>
Now, though the 'fair Lucretia,' as her
friends frequently called her, cared nothing
about the war in Egypt, she liked to read
about the movements of 'the upper ten
thousand'&mdash;their births, marriages, deaths,
and so forth&mdash;to all of which she addressed
herself first, as a City man does to the
money article.
</p>

<p>
'Where are the papers, Harry?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'I have ordered the butler to take them
all away,' said he.
</p>

<p>
'Even the <i>Morning Post</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; even the <i>Post</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Look here.  I do not wish Lady Puddicombe
to see <i>this</i>,' he replied, taking a
newspaper from his pocket, and indicating
a paragraph&mdash;another brief telegram from
Egypt&mdash;which ran thus:
</p>

<p>
'The detachment of the Black Watch
which was sent to Matarieh to make a
demonstration against the Bedouins of
Zeid-el-Ourdeh has been ordered back to
head-quarters, and seems to have lost its
other officer&mdash;a very distinguished
one&mdash;Captain Allan Graham, the Hon. the
Master of Aberfeldie, who is supposed to have
fallen into some of the same butcherly
hands amid which Professor Palmer and
his companions perished.'
</p>

<p>
'Good heavens! <i>her</i> brother!' exclaimed
Miss Hurdell, actually changing colour.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and it must be kept from her&mdash;to-day,
at least,' said Sir Harry, concealing
the fatal newspaper.
</p>

<p>
'Taken by the Bedouins&mdash;but she must
learn it some time.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I don't want her to learn it just
now, poor girl, at all events.  I can't make
a mull of the arrangements for the day,
and I don't want her to learn it here, if
possible.'
</p>

<p>
'Why not here?'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly not from me.'
</p>

<p>
'Why not from <i>you</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'I hate to be imparter of evil news.'
</p>

<p>
'Oho,' said Miss Hurdell, elevating her
eyebrows; 'sets the wind in that quarter?'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean, Lucretia?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, that she is not the first married
lady you have taken a tender interest in.'
</p>

<p>
'Lucretia!' exclaimed the baronet, in a
tone of angry expostulation, as some of
their gentlemen guests came noisily in, in
Russell cords, top boots, and spurs, some
in pink and some in black coats.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At that moment elsewhere were others
who were more deeply and terribly
interested in the startling tidings from
Matarieh, flashed by the same electric wire.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie was leisurely opening
the <i>Times</i>, which Mr.  Tappleton had duly
cut and aired for him, with the other
morning papers.  His eyes ran rapidly
over the columns for the last, news from
Egypt, which seemed very tame now, as
all the fighting and excitement were over;
so Lady Aberfeldie was not watching him,
as she used to do, with anxiety, and
neither was Olive, who was already deep in
the pages of the <i>Queen</i>, when an exclamation
that escaped him made them both start.
</p>

<p>
'What is the matter?' cried Lady
Aberfeldie.  'You look ill, dear.'
</p>

<p>
'Uncle, what do you see?' added Olive.
'Is anything wrong with&mdash;with&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Allan&mdash;yes.'
</p>

<p>
He was pale with a strange grey pallor,
totally unlike his usually sunburned and
healthy tint, and he looked dazed as his
face sank forward on his breast.
</p>

<p>
'Our poor boy&mdash;our poor boy!'
</p>

<p>
'God help us, Aberfeldie!  What is it?'
</p>

<p>
Olive snatched up the paper, and, after
reading the paragraph we have copied,
reeled into a chair.  And now a great
horror fell upon all the three, the mother's
memory flashing back to the baby-boy
that had crowed and smiled upon her
knee, and whose first tottering efforts to
cross the nursery floor she remembered
yet.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie, after recovering a little
from the shock, telegraphed to the
War-Office for further information, but could
obtain none.  They read the fatal paragraph
again and again, till every word of
it seemed to be burned into their brains,
and could but indulge in endless surmises,
and hope against hope; for had not the
public prints been teeming with the
harrowing details of the capture of Professor
Palmer, Captain Gill, and Lieutenant
Charrington, and of them being pitilessly
slaughtered by the Bedouins of the Aligal
tribe?
</p>

<p>
As Olive recalled all this, her blood
grew cold with apprehension.  The
paragraph, though a terrible one, was
frightfully vague.  He was 'supposed to have
fallen' into the hands of the Bedouins.
At all events, his party had come into
Grand Cairo <i>without him!</i>
</p>

<p>
She, like Lady Aberfeldie, could not
realise it for a time.  Alternately she sat
like one stunned, and then walked up and
down the room with her slender fingers
interlaced tightly and clasped upon her
head, as if she would thereby still the
trouble that throbbed in her brain and
repress her heavy sorrow.
</p>

<p>
In memory and imagination how often
did she rehearse her angry parting scene
with poor Allan and the last time she saw
him&mdash;the forcible embrace of Hawke
Holcroft; the latter's mocking love-making;
the horror and loathing with which his
touch inspired her; and Allan's terrible
glance as he flung away and left her&mdash;left
her for ever, as it seemed now.
</p>

<p>
Allan taken captive; he was sure to be
slain like those of whom she had read so
much lately.  He was gone from her, and
never more&mdash;never again could she show
her repentant love for him, or make up
for the omissions and follies of the past
by days of tenderness in the time to
come.
</p>

<p>
All was over now!
</p>

<p>
Profound was the speechless grief of
his parents, and she was past attempting
to console them.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Olive darling, don't look so
strange!' said Ruby Logan, who had
come on a visit to them at Puddicombe
Villa.
</p>

<p>
The tears were running down Ruby's
cheeks, while those of Olive were strangely
dry, as if her fount of tears was frozen
as yet.
</p>

<p>
Of Evan Cameron, if they thought at
all amid this home calamity, they knew
the worst&mdash;that he was dead and buried
like so many of his brother-soldiers who
fell at Tel-el-Kebir; but of Allan they had
yet the worst to know, if aught was ever
known at all, which was extremely improbable.
</p>

<p>
So the long day passed on and night
came, and Olive stood at the open window
looking out at the waters of Spithead, the
cold air from the sea blowing upon her
face.  She was in a kind of waking trance
rather than deliberate thought, and strange
figures like a phantasmagoria seemed to
evolve themselves out of the darkness.
</p>

<p>
But to return to the hunting breakfast
at Hurdell Hall.
</p>

<p>
All unconscious that a fresh sorrow
would fill her tender heart ere long,
Eveline came down in a charming morning-dress,
looking pure and pale as a young
arum lily, and was at once the cynosure
of many admiring eyes; for, in addition to
Sir Harry, Sir Paget, and Mr.  Poole, there
were seven or eight others present, all in
high spirits and eager for the sport.  Not
that Sir Paget affected field sports much,
but he thought that it became his position
to do so, and more especially as he was
the husband of so young a wife, to display
a certain amount of juvenility.
</p>

<p>
All present were ruddy-featured country
gentlemen of various ages, and while
discussing an ample and genuine
hunting-breakfast, though some who were
connected with the farming interest spoke
of the weather and the turnip-fly, of
the Devonshire breed and short-horns, of
mangold-wurzel and the rotation of crops,
matters about which, sooth to say, Sir
Paget and Mr.  Poole knew no more than
they did about the philosophy of the
Infinite, the conversation chiefly ran on the
matter in hand that day&mdash;the disadvantage
of having the dogs' collars too tightly
buckled, of coupling a young hound with
an old one, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
'A very bad plan,' said Sir Harry, 'as
the older dogs always vent their spite on
the younger by biting and rolling over
them.'
</p>

<p>
'Because the pulling on both sides is
not even,' said the Squire of Furzydowns,
a noted old sportsman, 'and, if a pair of
dogs so coupled come across a donkey,
there is sure to be a row, for, when a
bullock will look round in stupid wonder,
a donkey is apt to fly at hounds with tooth
and hoof.'
</p>

<p>
'A glorious morning this for the scent,'
said Sir Harry; 'a dry autumn one.  And
now let us be off.  The advantage of
hunting early is that cubs or foxes,
after a late supper or early breakfast, are
seldom in a condition to run long, and
get blown, as we all know.'
</p>

<p>
To Sir Paget, who had neither heart
nor interest in sport, and was rapidly
discussing the weather in all its
probabilities, as to whether there would be a
change or continuance of its present
aspect and condition, Sir Harry said,
</p>

<p>
'Puddicombe, are you still determined
to ride that bay horse with the white
star?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied Sir Paget, with just the
slightest <i>soupçon</i> of bravado.
</p>

<p>
'Remember, I have warned you that he
is rather a vicious brute, and apt to shy
his fences.'
</p>

<p>
'Please, do not ride him, Sir Paget,'
urged Eveline, in a whisper; 'do not, for
my sake.'
</p>

<p>
'I should rather think of my own, if
I do it for anyone's sake at all,' he snarled.
He could not forgive her the general
pallor and sadness of her face.  Death,
it is said, hallows the dead anew to the
living.  So it would be with the memory
of Evan Cameron in the mind of Eveline,
thought Sir Paget bitterly, nor was he
far wrong.  And, no doubt, it was rather
hard upon him to know that his wife's
thoughts were all of another; but how
innocently!
</p>

<p>
'As regards the bay horse,' he added,
'I will take my chance.'
</p>

<p>
He was loth to appear unable to do
anything, and always deemed such advice
as the present an imputation on his age
or capability; thus, he did many a thing
he would not have done had Eveline been
twenty years older.
</p>

<p>
After a few words aside with Sir Harry,
Eveline turned again to her husband, who
had now left the table, and was finally
adjusting his tan-coloured boot-tops.
</p>

<p>
'Do not ride the horse,' said she,
entreatingly.  'From what I hear, he is
beyond you.'
</p>

<p>
'Is he?' snarled Sir Paget, who was in
one of his worst humours this morning.
'But let me tell you, Lady Puddicombe,
that I know something about the choice of
a horse, if I don't about the choice of a wife!'
</p>

<p>
Eveline shrank back at this rude speech,
and thought that, sooth to say, he knew
little how to choose either.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;ride the horse, if you will,' said
she, resignedly.
</p>

<p>
'I shall!' he replied, sharply.
</p>

<p>
Lucretia detected that something was
wrong, and, raising her voice in reply to
something the Squire of Furzydown had
said, she exclaimed, laughingly,
</p>

<p>
'Ah, yes, the country is indeed glorious;
for here you can have eggs to breakfast
that are laid while your hair is being
dressed, and flowers on the table fresh
with the morning dew on them&mdash;yet, I
love London most, after all, especially in
the season.  And now,' she added, 'shall
my Charlie have its nicey, nicey breakfast
of cream?'
</p>

<p>
And she emptied a silver jug of the
latter into a china bowl for her wheezy
spaniel.
</p>

<p>
'What's up with old Sir Peter Teazle?'
whispered her brother.
</p>

<p>
'That is more than I can tell you, Harry.'
</p>

<p>
The two ladies came forth to the door
to see the gentlemen mount and depart.
</p>

<p>
Sir Paget got into his saddle with some
difficulty, as the bay hunter swayed round
and round, laid its ears back, and looked
askance at him, with red and bloodshot
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Eveline knew not of her brother's
calamity, and neither did Sir Paget, for
none had spoken of Egypt or Egyptian
news, and no one at Hurdell Hall was
particularly interested in the Black Watch,
herself excepted; but she felt a mysterious
and unaccountable prevision of coming
evil, and once more drew near to offer
her pretty hand to Sir Paget, doing so
with affected playfulness, as the eyes of
others were admiringly upon her; but he,
giving full rein to his thoughts about
that dead Cameron, whom she had loved
and he hated, stooped from his saddle,
and said to her, with a bland smile meant
also for other eyes,
</p>

<p>
'I have read, Lady Puddicombe, that
"nothing exalts a man so much in a
woman's mind as his dying.  Look at the
affection of widows as compared with that
of wives."  Ah, you are sorrowful, no
doubt; but sorrow takes a long while to
kill anyone.'
</p>

<p>
She knew well what he meant.  Her
pale cheek crimsoned, and she turned
without a word, deeming it both absurd
and cruel that he should thus be
retrospectively jealous.
</p>

<p>
The hunters rode merrily off, all in high
spirits, save Sir Paget, who jerked away
with his head and was disposed to sulk,
for the visit to Hurdell Hall had wrought
no change on Eveline; thus he did not,
like his companions, enjoy the delightful
sense of rest and peace in the cool
morning ride to covert.
</p>

<p>
The country was silent; ploughmen and
shepherds were, as yet, scarcely abroad;
and the full-fed cattle lay couched on the
damp grass that glistened with dew, and
from amid which their breaths rose like
silvery steam, and ere long the pack was
in sight&mdash;Grasper, Pilot, Holdfast, Catch,
and all the rest of them&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'With tails high mounted, ears hung low, and throats<br />
  With a whole gamut filled, of heavenly notes'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&mdash;at least in the estimation of the huntsmen.
</p>

<p>
Ere long the pack was put into the
covert, and stirrup leathers were tightened
and readjusted in hot haste, but with the
hunting, the whipping of unbroken hounds
that took to running after sheep, the
gallops over a few fields to get up an
appetite for an early luncheon at the
Squire of Furzydown's, the 'chopping' of
cubs, our story has nothing to do, save
in so far as one episode of the day is
concerned.
</p>

<p>
Sir Paget in his heart wished 'the
whole affair at Jericho,' or in a warmer
latitude.  To him it was no amusement to
set out without time for shaving, to
breakfast at an untimeous hour and before he
could get up an appetite, and to ride
through the morning mist, with icy feet
and grasping reins sodden with dew, with
the certainty of an attack of rheumatism,
when he should have been cosily nestling
in bed; and in addition to all these, having
a terrible conflict ever and anon with the
bay hunter.  Sir Harry thought him 'a
silly old fogie, who <i>would</i> go cub-hunting
to show the world how juvenile he
was,' and he was now beginning to console
himself with the prospect of a luxurious
luncheon at Furzydown and the long, lazy
afternoon he would enjoy there before
riding leisurely back in the evening to
dinner at Hurdell Hall, when Sir Harry
would be sure to sing them the old Coplow
hunt song&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Talk of horses and hounds<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And the system of kennel,<br />
  Give me Leicestershire nags<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And the hounds of old Menyell!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To Eveline the long day after the early
breakfast passed very slowly at the Hall.
She was in no anxiety for Sir Paget's
speedy return, especially after the cloudy
manner of his departure, but there were
no other lady visitors there just then, and
she and Lucretia Hurdell had not a
thought, sympathy, or topic in common,
and she sighed in utter weariness of spirit
as the October day drew to a close, and
the brown and purple shadows of evening
began to fall.
</p>

<p>
She thought how many such empty days
as this were before her, as autumn passed
into winter, winter into spring, and the
joyless summer&mdash;joyless at least to
her&mdash;would come again.  Every morning with
its hopelessness, every noon with its
listlessness, every evening seeming more blank
than the one that preceded it.  Would she
ever more feel bright and merry as at
Dundargue, and regain her sweet and
playful habits of caressing affection?
</p>

<p>
And for whom?
</p>

<p>
She stood in one of the many beautiful
Tudor bay windows overlooking the
terrace and chase, idly and full of her own
thoughts, and curiously enough, to her,
the rustle of the ivy on the painted panes,
of leaves as they fell from the trees, the
stillness of the evening hour, and the
cawing of the rooks in the old belfry of
the house seemed ominous of coming
evil.
</p>

<p>
Dusk had come on, the trees were taking
strange shapes against the sunset sky,
a bat circled noiselessly before her, and
the silver crescent of the moon came out
above a coppice.
</p>

<p>
A few of these trivial things were, by
after events, fixed in her memory, and
associated with that calm and almost sultry
October evening&mdash;the lurid brightness of
the sun as he set beyond the black stems
of the trees of the chase, the perfume of
roses from a majolica jardinière in the
bay window, and the angry hum of a great
bee entangled among the lace of the curtains.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she became aware that a group
of men, some on horseback and some on
foot, was slowly approaching the house
by the avenue.  Amid this group were four
carrying a burden&mdash;a man apparently&mdash;on
a door, or some such improvised litter.
</p>

<p>
Then appeared a groom leading a horse
by the bridle&mdash;the bay hunter with a white
star on his forehead!
</p>

<p>
A gasping cry escaped her; her poor,
torn heart leaped, and then seemed to
cease beating, with the dreadful certainty
that something&mdash;a new calamity&mdash;had
happened.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
ALLAN'S ADVENTURE.
</h3>

<p>
Evil tidings travel fast in these our days
of electricity, and true it was that the
unfortunate Allan Graham had fallen into
the hands of the Bedouins, but nothing
more was known.
</p>

<p>
He had disappeared from Matarieh!
</p>

<p>
When his detachment marched into
headquarters, Sergeant Farquharson reported
that the Master of Aberfeldie had left
the village for a ramble in the vicinity one
evening, so far as could be known, and had
not returned.  After a careful search by
the Highlanders at a certain spot, a
cigar-case which had been given to him by
Cameron of Stratherroch had been found,
and in the immediate vicinity the soil bore
the impression of foot and hoof marks, as
if a struggle of some kind had taken place.
If killed he had not been killed there, as
his body could not be found.
</p>

<p>
Beyond these meagre and unsatisfactory
details nothing more was known, save
that the Bedouins, intent on plunder and
outrage, had been daily hovering about in
the vicinity of the mounds and ruins of
Heliopolis.
</p>

<p>
Allan had felt very lonely after the loss
of his friend Cameron, all the more lonely
and full of tender interest for the general
circumstances of his life and fate, and
thus&mdash;as the sergeant reported&mdash;he had
rambled from the village where his men
were cantoned, a little way into the
vicinity to smoke and to ponder over the past
and future.
</p>

<p>
After Cameron's catastrophe he felt
himself more disposed to think of Olive,
and to think kindly and tenderly, and of
his mother's explanatory letter concerning
the extraordinary conduct of Holcroft and
Olive's love and grief; for we are told that
'among all the many kinds of first love,
that which begins in childish companionship
is the strongest and most enduring;
when passion comes to unite its
force to long affection, love is at its
spring tide,' and in childish affection had
the love of Allan Graham and Olive Raymond begun.
</p>

<p>
He lay stretched on a patch of grass,
where two or three banana-trees grew near
a ruined wall.  The setting sun shed its
red light far along the desert that
stretched to the land of Goshen, with its
luxuriant plains&mdash;yea, to the far horizon&mdash;and
Allan, a thoughtful and a well-read
man, as he looked around him, reflected,
as he often did, how strange was the land
where just then his duty led him&mdash;how
strange that the Egyptians were there,
without a tradition of a parent stock or
of another land; that it was only known
that a few generations after the Deluge they
had become a great nation.  In the words
of Apollonius Rhodius:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Oldest of mortals they who peopled earth,<br />
  Ere yet in heaven the sacred signs had birth.<br />
  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  .<br />
  Ere men the lunar wanderings learned to read,<br />
  Ere yet the heroes of Deucalion's blood<br />
  Pelasgia purpled with a glorious brood;<br />
  The fertile plains of Egypt flourished then,<br />
  Productive cradle of the first of men.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Allan thought as he manipulated and lit
another cigar, that the Egyptians of Arabi
Pasha must be of different and inferior
stuff from those to whom the poet of the
Argonauts referred.
</p>

<p>
And there, but a little way off, lay
Heliopolis and Matarieh, two places of
great and solemn memories&mdash;Heliopolis,
where Herodotus sought the wisest men in
Egypt; where Strabo says they pointed
out the house of Plato, where he then
resided; where Potiphar lived, who bought
Joseph from the patriarch; and Matarieh,
a spot where the Blessed Virgin, St.  Joseph,
and the Holy Child Jesus tarried, including
a well under a withered sycamore in
which&mdash;according to the legendaries&mdash;the
Holy Mother washed her Divine Infant's
linen; a spot the turbanned Mussulmans
still view with respect; and thereby was
the piper of Allan's company playing 'The
Evening Retreat,' and from the distance,
over the flat ground, came the sound of
his pipes, as he played 'The Birks of
Aberfeldie.'
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was that his reflections were
not of a very lively nature, or that he was
wearied by a long reconnaissance that
morning in the direction of El Khan-Kah,
but he, perilously for himself, dropped
insensibly asleep, all unaware that a party of
Bedouin horsemen, with hoofs muffled in
the soft sand, had formed a kind of
semi-circle round him, cutting off all chance of
escape.
</p>

<p>
He could not have been asleep more
than five minutes when the little prick of
a lance which drew blood roughly roused
him.  He started to his feet and found
himself confronted, surrounded indeed, by
some twenty dusky sons of the desert,
with hawk-like features, eyes that gleamed,
and teeth that glistened exultantly.
</p>

<p>
The adjective had rather an unpleasant
sound just then, so Allan said,
</p>

<p>
'And if not ransomed?'
</p>

<p>
The Bedouin slapped the butt of his
Remington rifle and grinned, showing all
his pearly teeth, with fierce signification.
</p>

<p>
'Who is your leader?' asked Allan, after
a pause.
</p>

<p>
'That you will discover when you see him.'
</p>

<p>
'I trust he will spare my life, at all
events.'
</p>

<p>
'What does your life, or the lives of all
the accursed Franks in the world, matter?'
exclaimed another Bedouin; 'may you all
perish by the hand of God by drowning,
as Pharaoh and his host perished, or by
His causing the earth to open and swallow
you up, as, the Koran tells us, happened
to Korah!'
</p>

<p>
Whether a rumour had reached them of
the sharp manner in which Colonel Warren
overtook and punished the Arabian
assassins of Professor Palmer and his
companions in misfortune, Allan knew not.  One
fact was evident, that they were resolved
to lose no time in carrying him off to their
tents among the sandy recesses of Jebel
Dimeshk.
</p>

<p>
They ambled on their way so fast, keeping
him at a species of run, that he was
on the point of sinking, and besought them
to spare him a little; so, at the command
of their leader, they halted for a little time
in the starlight, and, weary and worn with
toil and many emotions, he threw himself
on the ground to rest.
</p>

<p>
He closed his eyes, not to sleep, but to
think over his new and calamitous
position, and the chances of achieving an
escape from it.  If money was
required&mdash;unless the sum demanded proved too
enormous&mdash;he could produce a ransom, and he
turned uneasily on his sandy couch as he
thought over all his chances of success.
</p>

<p>
How like a horrible dream&mdash;a nightmare
it all appeared&mdash;as those terrible hours
spent in the vault at Dundargue had done.
</p>

<p>
What would be thought of his disappearance
by the regiment, and at home,
and memory flashed back to his soldierly
father and tender mother&mdash;for, with all
her aristocratic pride, tender she had ever
been to him&mdash;so his first thoughts were of
her.  'In the man whose childhood has
known caresses there is always a fibre of
memory that can be touched to gentle
issues;' so&mdash;a captain now, and in such
savage hands&mdash;his first ideas were of his
mother's grief, rather than of poor,
repentant Olive.
</p>

<p>
He might be butchered in the desert,
and never heard of again, for his life was
at the mercy and caprice of the most
lawless people in the world.
</p>

<p>
His disappearance as a mystery would
soon become public property at home.
There would, he knew, be all manner of
newspaper paragraphs, suggestions, and
surmises for a few weeks, and then, when
these ceased, his story and his fate would
be as much forgotten as last year's snow.
</p>

<p>
Again his captors began their march
towards the mountains; and times there
were, as he struggled forward to keep pace
with them, when, in fierce revolt against
the whole situation and its dreadful
uncertainties, he felt as if his heart would
burst, and a kind of agonised hopelessness
crept into it.
</p>

<p>
The Bedouins conveyed him some five
and twenty miles or more into the mountains,
till they reached a kind of oasis,
where their tents, which were very
numerous, stood.  Day was on the point of
breaking, and Allan was utterly worn out.
However keen excitement may be, Nature
will demand her due, so he slept on a
dirty Bedouin <i>barracan</i>, and ere he did so,
so great was the mental and bodily toil
he had undergone, that he felt a kind of
pleasure as drowsiness came upon him&mdash;a
happiness to find oblivion&mdash;oblivion for a
time even.  To forget was a species of
joy.  And so he slept, despite those plagues
of Egypt, the gnats, mosquitoes, and sand-flies.
</p>

<p>
In the morning he was informed that
the chief of the tribe, who would be the
arbiter of his fate, was as yet absent; and
that, if he made the slightest attempt to
escape, he would be shot down without
mercy.
</p>

<p>
'God is great,' added his informant, who,
like most Mussulmans, interlarded his
conversation with pious allusions and
quotations from the Koran; 'and whatever
He has decreed will and must come to
pass.'
</p>

<p>
For breakfast they brought him a few
dates soaked in melted butter, a little
sweet milk and curds.  So simple are the
habits of the Bedouins that one can
subsist for a whole day on such a repast, and
deem himself happy and luxurious if he
can add a small quantity of corn-flour or
a little ball of rice.  Meat being usually
reserved for the greatest festivals, they
rarely kill a kid, save for a marriage or a
funeral, though some tribes eat the flesh
of the gazelle and the desert cow.
</p>

<p>
A couple of days on such food, with
rough usage and toil&mdash;for they compelled
him to groom their horses&mdash;a toil degrading
to a man of spirit, rendered Allan
somewhat faint.
</p>

<p>
He learned incidentally that there was
another Frank a prisoner in their hands,
who no doubt, like himself, was anxiously
awaiting the return of the Bedouin chief.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
AMONG THE DWELLERS IN TENTS.
</h3>

<p>
With waking each morning Allan's miserable
thoughts returned, and, undeterred
by the threat of being shot if he attempted
to escape, he thought of nothing else, and
closely inspected the Bedouin camp and
its vicinity with that view, despite the
warning of the principal Bedouin, whose
name he ascertained to be Abdallah, or
'the servant of God,' who repeatedly told
him that he hoped 'the English would
have their faces confounded,' the
exclamation of the Angel Gabriel when he
threw a handful of gravel against the foe
at the battle of Bedr.
</p>

<p>
As the Bedouins never reside in towns
or occupy houses, they live in encampments,
pitching their tents wherever they
can find pasturage for their horses and
camels, changing the site of their abode
as often as the support of their cattle or
the vicinity of a more powerful and hostile
tribe may compel them.  Sometimes they
sow a little Indian corn, and return to
reap it when grown.  The milk of their
cattle and a few esculents found in the
desert are their chief food.
</p>

<p>
All are trained to the use of arms, and
are skilled in horsemanship, and Allan
could perceive that the care of the flocks
and herds was committed mostly to the
women, while the youth of the tribe&mdash;all
fellows spare of form, light of limb, and
active as their native gazelles&mdash;were in
their saddles scouring round the camp,
and practising the use of the javelin, the
spear, and the Remington rifle, with which
many in Lower Egypt were now armed,
as they had been flung away in thousands
by the fugitive soldiers of Arabi.
</p>

<p>
The innate love of freedom which is
fostered by the facilities for a nomadic
life, and the desert-locomotion which his
horses and camels afford him, impart to
the Bedouin a dignified and haughty bearing,
which contrasts powerfully with the
servility and pusillanimity of the rustic
sons of Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Unchanged from unknown generations,
they are the same as when Volney wrote
of them&mdash;'Pacific in their camp, they are
everywhere else in a habitual state of war.
The husbandmen whom they pillage hate
them; the travellers whom they despoil
speak ill of them; and the Turks, who
dread them, endeavour to divide and
corrupt them.'
</p>

<p>
Their wandering life affords more
freedom to their women than usually falls to
the lot of Moslem females, and the wild
desert, where they always dwell, becomes
in many cases the actual scene of those
keen and passionate love adventures which
are depicted in the tales and poems of the
Arabians.
</p>

<p>
If Allan would escape from these Bedouins,
he would require to have all his
wits about him, and not risk the slightest
mistake.
</p>

<p>
'The child of the desert, reared in
continual wandering, possesses in the fullest
degree the activity of <i>sense</i>,' says a writer.
'His spirit is all abroad in his perceptive
organs; he is voluble and sagacious, quick,
passionate, and sympathetic, but by no
means intellectual.  Quickness of perception
and strength of imagination are
mental characteristics of the Bedouin, and
superstition, the child of ignorance, is
nowhere more powerful than among the
wanderers of the desert.'
</p>

<p>
But in what direction was Allan to bend
his steps, if he contrived to elude his
captors?  He might only wander into the
barren desert&mdash;a sea of sand&mdash;there to
perish of hunger and thirst, or be
overtaken to suffer a cruel death.
</p>

<p>
Reflection showed him that it would
be better to temporise&mdash;to await the
return of the sheikh, and endeavour to
treat about a ransom.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the encampment of rude tents,
which they carry with them from wadi
to wadi&mdash;the male portion employing their
horses and camels in the transport from
one oasis to another&mdash;Allan could see the
desert, traversed by the camel-route to
Suez by Regum-el-Khel, spreading far
away to the north-east, the horizon
enveloped in fog in the morning and
evening, for the season was moist now.
</p>

<p>
Near the camp was the tomb of a
santon, or holy man, surmounted by a
little white dome, and shaded by date-trees.
</p>

<p>
Had the camp been pitched on higher
ground, instead of in a green hollow, Allan
might have known his precise whereabouts,
as he would have seen in the distance to
the south Mount Mokattam, crowned by
the citadel of Cairo, with the many
minarets of the great capital at its base.
</p>

<p>
On the third day, a commotion was
caused by the arrival of the sheikh, who
rode in, accompanied by an escort, all
well armed and mounted.  Allan was at
once brought before him, full of natural
anxiety to learn his fate, and great was
his satisfaction to discover in him
Zeid-el-Ourdeh, the Bedouin whom he had
found wounded and bleeding near the
camp of the Black Watch, and whom
he had succoured and sent rearward to
the hospital at Ismailia.
</p>

<p>
The recognition was mutual.  He sprang
from his horse, tossed the bridle to an
attendant, and welcomed Allan to his tents,
adding,
</p>

<p>
'I called you my brother when, after
Kassassin, I thought the hand of death
was upon me; and you are not the less my
brother now that you have eaten bread
and salt with my people.'
</p>

<p>
He had quite recovered from his
sword-wound apparently, and as he moved about
in his long, flowing dress, with the ends
of his shawl-turban floating over his
shoulders, his bearing and aspect were
stately and graceful.
</p>

<p>
Allan, encouraged to find that his
personal safety was now so far secured,
ventured to speak of his liberty; but Zeid
shook his head, while a glitter, suggestive,
not of cruelty, but unmistakably of greed
and avarice, came into his eyes; and he
informed his prisoner that he would have
to accompany the tribe further into the
desert, to another oasis, where the grass
was green.
</p>

<p>
His heart sank on hearing this.
</p>

<p>
Whether Zeid-el-Ourdeh meant to
retain him as a species of hostage, in the
hope of a ransom, or in the absurd idea
of attaching him to his own fortunes, as
useful from his knowledge of arms and
European tactics, Allan could not divine.
Anyway, his life for the present was safe
in his hands, though Zeid's power might
fail to protect him from other Bedouins, or
the exasperated fellaheen of Arabi Pasha.
</p>

<p>
Zeid gave him back his claymore, which
Allan greatly valued, as it was a family
heirloom&mdash;an old Ferrara blade, which his
father and grandfather had worn in the
Black Watch long before him.
</p>

<p>
Zeid's own sword was a very remarkable
one, which he had found in the sand
near the Red Sea.  It was long, straight,
and double-edged, with a cross-guard of
the middle ages, and had evidently been
the trusty blade of some pious crusader,
who had lost it, with his life perhaps, on
the way to Jerusalem; and, like the sword
of the Cid, it was inscribed, <i>Ave Maria
gratia plena dominus tecum</i>.
</p>

<p>
'You look half-starved!' said Zeid, as
he regarded Allan's face.
</p>

<p>
'I am wholly starved.  I have had only
some dates and milk for three days,'
replied Allan, who, with some satisfaction,
heard him order a kid to be killed, that
they might have a repast together, and
then he ordered the other Frankish
prisoner to be brought before him.
</p>

<p>
'Holcroft!' exclaimed Allan, in a breathless
voice, and scarcely able to believe his
senses, when one, who seemed undoubtedly
that obnoxious personage, was dragged
before the sheikh with a sullen and defiant
air scarcely suited to the situation.  His
European surtout and trousers were
discoloured, tattered, and torn; he had on a
scarlet tarboosh, and wore his fair beard at
some length now.
</p>

<p>
'Holcroft!' exclaimed Allan again, 'you
here?  Here in Egypt&mdash;what miracle is this?'
</p>

<p>
'Your words express more surprise than
pleasure,' replied Holcroft, while
Zeid-el-Ourdeh looked from one to the other in
some surprise at their evident sudden
recognition.  'Ah,' he continued, with a
malevolent grimace, 'you thought I was
drowned, no doubt, and feeding the fishes
in the Solent!'
</p>

<p>
'You are reserved for a drier and more
deserved death, I presume,' said Allan.
</p>

<p>
'Sneer as you may over me and my
misfortunes&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Misfortunes, you miscreant!  But how
in the name of wonder&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'If you care to know how I come to be
here, in the same unpleasant and unsavoury
hands with yourself&mdash;a gunboat picked me
up off Southsea, for I am a strong swimmer,
but, for all that, was too exhausted to
be sent ashore.  I was put into the
sick-bay and brought on here, all the way to
Ismailia, and then turned adrift to live by
my wits.  I made my way to Cairo, and
was fain to become billiard-marker at the
hotel where I saw you, and once again at
the review before the Abdin palace.  The
196hotels, and cafes too, tired of me.  I was
setting out on foot to overtake some of
your invalids en route to Ismailia when these
infernal Bedouins nabbed me, and I am
here.'
</p>

<p>
'And now that you are here, may I
inquire what you mean to do with your
precious self?'
</p>

<p>
'Take office under the Khedive's government.
There will be no end of nice pickings
for Europeans now that the shindy is
over.'
</p>

<p>
'Office&mdash;as what?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, anything&mdash;I am not particular&mdash;Inspector-General
of Harems would suit
me to a hair&mdash;down to the ground, in fact.'
</p>

<p>
'Bantering villain!  And how about
those diamonds you stole from Miss
Raymond&mdash;a luckless heirloom in our family,
always bringing evil to the holder or
wearer?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, they have brought no evil to me
yet,' replied Holcroft, with a defiant grin&mdash;a
dogged one too; 'I have them safe here,'
he added, slapping his breast pocket, 'and
don't mean to part with them.  They are
quite a fortune to me.'
</p>

<p>
And he had the folly, the madness, in
mere bravado, to show them for a moment.
</p>

<p>
'Keep these, fellow&mdash;they are certain to
bring you ill-luck in some way.'
</p>

<p>
Allan was nearer the truth than he
thought, as the sharp eyes of the sheikh saw
the flash of the stones, and the spirit of
acquisition was instantly kindled in his
breast.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' thought Allan, 'this unexpected
meeting is a strange coincidence; but, as
Miss Braddon says, "life is made up of
curious coincidences."'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
KISMET.
</h3>

<p>
Allan was aware that the sheikh had seen
the jewels, though for a moment only, that
were in Holcroft's possession.  He knew
that greed and the <i>Lex Talionis</i>, or law of
retaliation, are distinctive marks of the
Bedouin character; but he also knew that
their regard for hospitality is not a less
remarkable characteristic, and that even an
enemy is secure if he can obtain refuge in
a tent.
</p>

<p>
Ali Bey (otherwise known as Don Pedro
de la Badia) relates that when a Bedouin
heard that his wife had given food to his
mortal foe, who had sought charity at his
tent, not knowing who or what he was,
observed, 'I should probably have slain my
enemy had I found him here; but I should
not have spared my wife had she neglected
the sacred laws of hospitality.'
</p>

<p>
But Allan felt doubtful how the sheikh
might be disposed to respect these laws
in the case of one like Holcroft, who
had not fled to his tents for succour,
but been brought there a captive, and had
comported himself in a dogged and defiant
way.
</p>

<p>
'And you had actually sunk to being a
billiard-marker?' said Allan.
</p>

<p>
'For a time&mdash;yes; nothing comes amiss,
so money comes withal.  When taking
stock of my affairs I found them shady&mdash;very;
my assets falling far short of my
liabilities.  Thus I was forced to play
out the only card left me, and put
the screw upon your wealthy cousin,
Miss Raymond.  Sorry I can't give you a
copy of that remarkable photo of Olive
and myself, of which, no doubt, you
all know now.'
</p>

<p>
'All,' replied Allan, amazed that the
man could exult in his utter and degrading
villainy.  To him it seemed almost
incredible that one who was by birth a
gentleman, the son of a gallant old officer, and
bad been the associate of gentlemen, could
fall so low as Holcroft had done, and be so
callous and shameless.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, for a glass of bitter or Burton and
a good cigar!' said Holcroft; 'and, by the
way, as you seem to speak his lingo, will
you ask this old nigger in the striped
counterpane why he keeps me here, and what
he means to do with me.'
</p>

<p>
Allan inquired this of Zeid in Arabic;
but to him it seemed that Hawke
Holcroft totally failed to comprehend or to
take it in that he was in any peril at all.
As an Englishman he thought that no
'dashed foreigner' dared meddle with or
molest him, yet these Bedouins had him
at their mercy sure enough; and to judge
of matters or chances by the standard of
Regent Street and Piccadilly, would hardly
do under the summits of the Jebel Dimeshk.
</p>

<p>
Remarking the tarboosh worn by Holcroft,
and using Allan as an interpreter,
the sheikh asked,
</p>

<p>
'Are you a Mussulman?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' replied Holcroft, with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
'A Christian, then?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' was the strange response.
</p>

<p>
'You must believe either in the Prophet
or Christ?'
</p>

<p>
'I believe in neither.'
</p>

<p>
'Unhappy wretch!' exclaimed the sheikh,
with astonishment in his tone.
</p>

<p>
'Men may believe in both, yet follow
neither.'
</p>

<p>
'So do the devils believe&mdash;and like devils
tremble' said the Bedouin.
</p>

<p>
'Well, I do not.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you feel no trust in God?'
</p>

<p>
'None!' was the blunt and defiant reply.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'He has always left me to myself.'
</p>

<p>
Allan sighed at this hopeless response,
while the blasphemy of it filled the
Bedouin&mdash;who, whatever his shortcomings in
the way of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> were, was pious
in his way&mdash;with horror and indignation.
After a pause, he said,
</p>

<p>
'Look at his eyes&mdash;they are grey; and
does not the Koran say that on the last
day "we shall gather the wicked together
having grey eyes."
</p>

<p>
The twentieth chapter certainly has that
curious remark, for with the Arabs&mdash;a
black-eyed race&mdash;to have grey eyes is the
mark of an enemy or a person to be avoided.
</p>

<p>
'You knew this man in Frangistan!'
said Zeid.
</p>

<p>
'Too well,' replied Allan.
</p>

<p>
'Then he has wronged thee?' was the
sharp question and suspicion of the
Bedouin.
</p>

<p>
'Deeply; he tried to kill me, indeed.'
</p>

<p>
'Yet he lives?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Why is this?'
</p>

<p>
'I thought he was dead&mdash;drowned,'
replied Allan, evasively.
</p>

<p>
'Take this sword and smite off his head.
The blade is sharp enough.'
</p>

<p>
Allan shook his head and drew back.
</p>

<p>
'You Franks are fools!' said Zeid, while
the miserable Holcroft, though he knew
not a word of what passed, guessed the
terrible import of it, and glanced
imploringly at Allan.
</p>

<p>
'Do you think,' said Zeid, after a pause,
'that his neck is turned to ivory, as the
Koran tells us that of Moses was, when
he was about to be beheaded for slaying
an Egyptian?'
</p>

<p>
'The Koran&mdash;always that weary Koran!'
thought Allan, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'Will you tell him,' said Holcroft, 'that,
if he expects a ransom from me, I have
neither a friend nor a farthing in the
world.'
</p>

<p>
Allan did so.
</p>

<p>
'Liar! may God burn thee!' exclaimed
Zeid, as he thought of the diamonds, and,
acting in obedience to a sign from him,
Abdallah, unknown to Holcroft, was
stealing behind him, armed with a heavy and
deeply curved Damascus sabre of the
keenest edge.
</p>

<p>
There was a flash in the sunshine as
the blade was swept round by a swift
back-handed stroke, and the head of the
miserable Hawke Holcroft rolled along
the ground, as his body fell prostrate on
it in a heap, with the red blood welling
out from every vein and artery of the
neck.
</p>

<p>
'He has met his <i>kismet</i>,' said Zeid,
complacently.
</p>

<p>
At this sudden catastrophe, Allan turned
away horrified&mdash;utterly appalled.  He had
seen men wounded in every way, and
mutilated too by shot and shell, but had
never seen aught like this&mdash;and in cold
blood, too!
</p>

<p>
'He believed neither in the Prophet
nor in Christ,' said Zeid, complacently;
'now that he is in hell, that cemetery for
lost souls, he may learn the truth.'
</p>

<p>
And, torn from the pocket of the
wretched creature's tattered surtout, the fatal
diamonds were placed in the hands of
Zeid-el-Ourdeh.
</p>

<p>
Allan, as he saw them sparkling in
the sunshine, thought of all he heard his
father say of them, and marvelled to whom
they would bring evil next.  If to the
sheikh, he was fated never to know.
</p>

<p>
It was some time before he recovered
the shock this scene gave him, but it
rendered his desire to be gone&mdash;to be
free&mdash;irrepressible; yet he dreaded just then to
approach the subject with Zeid.  Whether
it was the excitement of a blood-shedding
or acquisition of the diamonds, or both
together, Zeid was in high good humour,
and about noon gave Allan a dinner
unusually sumptuous in his own tent.
</p>

<p>
Upon a tray of tinned copper were
placed saucers of pickles, salad, and salt,
with thin cakes of bread, and in the centre
a dish of rice, highly seasoned with spice
and saffron.  Neither forks nor spoons
were there, and he had to use his fingers.
Thus it made him shiver to see the sheikh
plunge his copper-coloured digits into the
dish one moment and thrust them
half-way down his open throat the next.
</p>

<p>
He always clapped his hands when he
wanted any attendance.
</p>

<p>
A cotton towel surrounded the tray on
the ground, on which they occasionally
wiped their hands; then pipes of tobacco
followed, and the sheikh became sociable,
as he reclined back against a saddle over
which some shawls and a barracan were
spread, and Allan began to cast about in
his own mind how to approach the subject
of his departure.
</p>

<p>
He gathered courage from the knowledge
that, after eating bread and salt
together, or even salt alone, in the East,
produces mutual obligations of friendship.
</p>

<p>
The sheikh was a man of great piety,
after his own fashion.  He said his prayers
five times daily, the first time being
between daybreak and sunrise, turning
towards Mecca, and five times daily he
washed his hands.  He was a firm
believer in magic, and that there existed
somewhere in Upper Egypt, Ishmonie, or
the Petrified City&mdash;so called on account of
the great number of statues, representing
men, women, children, and animals, with
which its silent streets abound&mdash;all of
which he believed to have been once
animated creatures, miraculously changed
into stone by a whisper of the prophet,
in all the various attitudes of standing,
sitting, or falling, but none of which are
ever visible save to true believers.
</p>

<p>
He also firmly believed in the miraculous
egg laid by a hen after Tel-el-Kebir,
on which was inscribed the words&mdash;'Arabi
has lost the battle because he mutilated
the corpses of the enemy.  Allah has
punished him, but He will give victory to him
in the end, if he will keep the commands
in the future.'
</p>

<p>
'Hah!' said he, after a long pull at his
chibouque, 'at Tel-el-Kebir your bare-legged
men came on as hell will come at
the last day.'
</p>

<p>
'How is that?'
</p>

<p>
'As the Koran tells us, with seventy
thousand halters, each dragged by seventy
thousand angels&mdash;a power nothing can
withstand.'
</p>

<p>
'Accursed as you unbelievers are,' said
he, after a pause, 'God seems to give you
a wondrous power, even as he gave Solomon
the gift of miracles in a degree greater
than anyone before him; the animals and
the vegetables obeyed him, and he was
carried by the winds of heaven above the
stars therein, and his power over the genii
was by a seal ring, of which one part was
brass and the other iron, and upon it was
graven the great name of God.  Yes,
though unbelievers, you are swift in action
as the pigeons of Aleppo; not like the
Osmanli, who would catch hares in waggons,'
he added, with reference to the
proverbial slowness of the Turks.
</p>

<p>
'Sheikh,' said Allan, in his most persuasive
manner, 'you know that I befriended
you when in sore peril.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, as my brother would have done,'
said Zeid, his expressive face lighting up
and his black eyes sparkling under the
hood of his burnous, as he pointed with
his left hand to his right shoulder, which
had been slashed by the long sword of one
of our Life-Guardsmen.
</p>

<p>
'Well, in memory of that you will allow
me to depart home freely to my people?'
</p>

<p>
'Why?  Are you not comfortable enough
here?  Is not one place that God has made
as good as another?  And who and what
are your people?  With all their skill and
power, they are but wretched unbelievers,
who go to battle with their legs bare,
accompanied by bags of devils, that squall
and groan, like those who strove to defame
Solomon.'
</p>

<p>
'Do be just, sheikh!' urged Allan.
</p>

<p>
'I shall&mdash;is not justice the sister of
piety?'
</p>

<p>
'You will allow me to go, then?'
</p>

<p>
'I have not said so.  Why leave the
desert and go back to cities, where men
become intoxicated with the pleasures of
this life, and forget that which is to
come?'
</p>

<p>
Allan sighed.  By this time he was weary
of the sheikh and his stilted conversation.
</p>

<p>
Beginning with the inevitable aphorism,
'There is only one God and Mohammed
is his Prophet,' the sheikh, after a pause,
continued thus between long whiffs of his
cherry-stick pipe: 'Stay with us and pray
with us five times a day, each time turning
to the Kebbah; eat not in the daytime
during the whole feast of Ramadan, make
the pilgrimage to Mecca, give alms to
the widow and the orphan.  These are
the sources from which all goodness
springs.  Stay with us and do all these
things.  Become my brother indeed&mdash;a
son of the desert.  Why go back among
the accursed Franks?  You know how to
use the sword, the spear, and the rifle.
Stay with us; we shall give you a rich
pelisse, a good blood mare, and a Bedouin
girl, beautiful, good, and virtuous.'
</p>

<p>
This programme scarcely suited the
views of the Master of Aberfeldie, but the
situation was such a grave one that he
dared not laugh at it.
</p>

<p>
'But you need not go to Mecca,' said
the sheikh, as an after-thought.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'God is everywhere&mdash;why seek Him at
Mecca, when we have Him here in the
desert?'
</p>

<p>
Allan pled hard, and spoke of bribes
and ransom, but apparently in vain, and
he began to get sorely perplexed by the
prospect before him, especially if the tribe
took their departure&mdash;of which there was
every prospect&mdash;in search of 'pastures
new' further from Grand Cairo, and
towards the plain of Muggreh.
</p>

<p>
He was obliged to dissemble his disgust
and mortification, and could only hope of
finding an opportunity of 'making,' as he
thought, 'a clean bolt of it.'
</p>

<p>
A few uneventful days passed, and during
these he could not help being struck with
the simplicity of the domestic life and
manners of the Sheikh Zeid-el-Ourdeh
and his family.
</p>

<p>
Though the commander of more than
six hundred horse, he did not disdain to
saddle and bridle his own steed or to give
him his barley and chopped straw.
</p>

<p>
In his humble tent his wife made the
coffee, kneaded the dough, and cooked all
the victuals, though a kind of princess in
the desert and among her people.  His
daughters and kinswomen attended to the
linen, and, closely veiled, went to the wells
or springs for water, with classic-looking
pitchers of brown ware balanced on their
gracefully-carried heads&mdash;in ways, manners,
and ideas all unchanged from those
described by Homer, or as we find them in
the history of Abraham and in Genesis.
</p>

<p>
It was while a prisoner thus with Zeid,
that Allan heard the strange story
promulgated by Arabi, that all Egyptians who
fell fighting for the faith would come
back to earth as spirits mounted on
snow-white horses and armed with miraculous
swords to completely exterminate the
British&mdash;an idea evidently borrowed from
the Koran, which ascribes Mohamed's
victory at Bedr to his having as allies
three thousand spirits led by the angel
Gabriel mounted on his horse Haizum.
</p>

<p>
On this subject the Paris <i>Temps</i> recorded
that an Arab servant belonging to their
correspondent asked the latter whether he
had seen any of the returned spirits from
Kassassin in recent encounters, and, on
being answered in the negative, declared
that the correspondent could not see them
because he was <i>not</i> an Englishman.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
THE LAST OF SIR PAGET.
</h3>

<p>
And now to glance homeward at more
civilised scenes&mdash;to the catastrophe at
Hurdell Hall.
</p>

<p>
The terrible tidings were soon made
known to Eveline that Sir Paget, on the
homeward ride from Furzydown, had been
suddenly seized by an unaccountable fit
of irritation, and, in defiance of all advice
and entreaty, though a bad horseman, had
lashed and spurred the bay hunter&mdash;a
vicious brute&mdash;while needlessly rushing it
at a high fence, and been thrown with
terrible violence.
</p>

<p>
In short, his neck was broken, and he
had died on the spot without pain.  A
door had been procured from an adjoining
barnyard, and on this humble bier the
body had been brought to the Hall.
</p>

<p>
As one in a dreadful dream Eveline
listened to all this, and the awful shadow
of something&mdash;<i>something</i>, as yet unthought
of and unconceived, fell blackly and bleakly
across the dark horizon of her life, as
she saw the body borne past her&mdash;the body
she shrank from touching&mdash;borne past
her indoors; and a darker shadow would
yet fall, when she learned the news from
Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Weakened by all she had undergone
hitherto, and overcome by the sudden
horror of the present event, Eveline could
scarcely stand.
</p>

<p>
'You cannot go up the staircase to bed,'
said Lucretia Hurdell, kindly.
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;yes; yes, I can,' replied Eveline,
with dry lips.
</p>

<p>
But she sank in a heap on the Persian
carpet.
</p>

<p>
'Lift her up, Harry,' said his sister.
</p>

<p>
Harry was only too ready, and raised
her at once in his strong arms.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, please to put me down,' said
Eveline, imploringly; 'don't touch me&mdash;I
can walk.'
</p>

<p>
'Nonsense, dear Lady Puddicombe&mdash;you
must permit me,' he urged.
</p>

<p>
And holding the helpless girl close to
him&mdash;so close as to preclude all attempted
resistance on her part&mdash;he bore her steadily
upstairs, and past the room where <i>it</i> lay,
covered with a sheet, and straight to a
new apartment prepared for her, followed
by his sister and Clairette.
</p>

<p>
The fast, horsey baronet's breath mingled
with hers, but unconsciously for her,
poor girl!  Her soft face reclined on his
shoulder, and he saw just then, more than
ever, how fair and delicate&mdash;how very
lovely she was; and he began to develop&mdash;or
scheme out&mdash;some very ambitious
plans of his own.
</p>

<p>
Hurdell Hall and the Hurdell estates
were rather deeply dipped, and thus 'Old
Pudd's money, even if encumbered by
such a lovely bride, would be very
acceptable when the time came.'
</p>

<p>
So thought Sir Harry, with the man&mdash;but
a few hours dead&mdash;lying stark and
stiff within a few yards of him.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for Eveline, 'Nature's
innocent opium, fatigue'&mdash;with her it was
fatigue of mind&mdash;procured her some sleep;
thus she was supposed to be the better
able for what she would be compelled to
hear on the morrow, as a telegram had
arrived from Lady Aberfeldie&mdash;addressed
to her&mdash;a document that, as Sir Harry
said, 'proved a regular floorer, by Jove!'
</p>

<p>
In the morning, he said,
</p>

<p>
'She must not be told, as yet, of what
yesterday's paper contained&mdash;the mysterious
disappearance of her brother, to whom
she seems most tenderly attached.'
</p>

<p>
'But how about the telegram from
Southsea?' asked Lucretia.  'No doubt
it refers to that event.  Indeed, we do
not know what it contains, good or bad
news.  It must be given to her; we have
no right to conceal or keep it back, and
may commit mischief by doing so.'
</p>

<p>
Sir Harry tugged his straw-coloured
moustache with an air of perplexity, and
said, while busy with coffee and game-pie,
</p>

<p>
'By all means, then; if Lady Puddicombe
is to know about her brother&mdash;which,
I fear, will cut her up more than
poor old Puddicombe's catastrophe&mdash;there
is no one who can break the news to her
better than you, Lucretia.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'You are such a precious cool hand,
don't you know.'
</p>

<p>
Miss Hurdell looked as if this was not
very flattering, but quitted the luxurious
breakfast-table, saying,
</p>

<p>
'Poor thing, she is not fit to hear any
more bad news; she has such a worn-out
look already.'
</p>

<p>
The telegram <i>did</i> refer to Allan&mdash;a most
unwise mode of breaking such terrible
intelligence&mdash;but Lady Aberfeldie never
doubted that her daughter must have seen
the public prints.
</p>

<p>
Eveline uttered a low wail, and fainted.
A cry of terror escaped Clairette, who
drew away the pillows from under her
mistress's head, opened the collar of her
laced night-dress, to let the air play freely
about her delicate neck and white bosom,
while she bathed her temples freely with
Rimmel and Eau-de-Cologne; and Miss
Hurdell, whose nature was somewhat hard,
and who had never seen anyone faint
before, looked on with some fear and
suspicion, as animation slowly came back
to the lovely face, with gasping sobs on
the lips and heavy respirations, which
made her bosom heave and fall.
</p>

<p>
George Eliot says, with truth, 'It is
a wonderful moment the first time we
stand by one who has fainted, and witness
the fresh birth of consciousness spreading
itself over the blank features like the
rising sunlight on the Alpine summits
that lay ghastly and dead under the
leaden twilight.  A slight shudder, and
the frost-bound eyes recover their liquid
light, for an instant they show the inward
semi-consciousness of an infant, then with
a little start they open wider, and begin
to look, the present is visible, but only
as a strange writing, and the interpreter
memory is not yet there.'
</p>

<p>
The dull mental agony that comes after
acute anguish or a great shock, proved too
much for Eveline now, and she became
prostrate, seriously ill in the hands of her
new friends, and Clairette wrote instantly
to Olive Raymond.
</p>

<p>
Eveline at times burst into passionate
sobs, then she would lie very still with her
long lashes closed and the tears oozing
from under them, slowly down her pale
cheeks, though her slender throat would
be agitated by those after-sobs that
seem so uncontrollable.  Other times she
would lie perfectly still, lost in deep
thought, as she pictured all the past and
tender love her manly brother had ever
borne her, and how gently he pitied her,
when he discovered her love for the lost
Evan Cameron.
</p>

<p>
'The devil!' said Sir Harry to himself,
as he smoked a cigar on the terrace under
her windows, and looked up there from
time to time and twirled his long fair
moustache; 'who could have imagined all
this!  She must have loved that old fellow
after all.'
</p>

<p>
'In the light of a father, perhaps,'
suggested Mr. Pyke Poole.
</p>

<p>
'Of course&mdash;you are right; how else
could she have looked upon him.  Her
sorrow must be for her brother.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps both.'
</p>

<p>
'Who the devil are all those cads crossing
the park?' exclaimed Sir Harry, with
sudden anger, perhaps at his friend's mild
suggestion.
</p>

<p>
'The coroner's inquest.'
</p>

<p>
The latter was 'a thundering bore' to
Sir Harry, who was provoked to see 'a
parcel of louts in half bullet hats' gaping
about the Hall.  However, the matter was
soon over, permission was given for the
interment, and, after unlimited brandies-and-sodas
in the butler's premises, they all
departed in high good-humour with
themselves.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie came to attend the
funeral, and brought with him Olive to
remain with Eveline.  Lady Aberfeldie
did not think the Hurdells 'good form,' so
she remained, as yet, at Southsea.
</p>

<p>
Eveline's father and cousin were shocked
by the expression of her face.  Intense
mental pain seemed written on her brow;
and her eyes, if sunk and inflamed, seemed
to have gathered much of intensity.
</p>

<p>
The stipulated number of days allowed
by custom to elapse between the day of
death and that of interment were over,
and the funeral too; Lord Aberfeldie, Sir
Harry, Mr. Pyke Poole, and many others
in scarfs and hatbands of wonderful length
had departed with the remains for
Slough-cum-Sloggit by train, and some of their
carriages were now returning through the
sunshiny park, where the soft rain was
falling, and, as the clouds were breaking
up, bright gleams of radiance danced along
the sward.
</p>

<p>
Unused to death and unsympathetic,
Lucretia Hurdell felt intense relief.
</p>

<p>
The great Tudor hall, with all its
window blinds down and shrouded in silence
and gloom, had seemed to her for all these
days like one large sepulchre, though an
odour of hothouse flowers was everywhere
as the gardener brought all his
treasures&mdash;hyacinths, waxen camelias, gardenia,
faint Dijon roses, and so forth&mdash;to decorate
the corridor, the death-chamber, and
the coffin, while, unconscious of all the
mischief he had wrought, the bay hunter
enjoyed his corn and beans as usual.
</p>

<p>
So the coffin was laid in 'the family
vault,' where lay the first baronet of the
House of Puddicombe and the first wife of
Sir Paget.
</p>

<p>
'I shall never lie there,' thought
Eveline, with a shudder, when her father,
before returning to Southsea, gave her the
final details.
</p>

<p>
Poor Sir Paget was gone, but no one
seemed sad about it, and everyone seemed
to grow bright now that he was gone
finally.  Sunshine and air came freely into
the house through the open windows
now, and the nameless hush that for days
had pervaded the vicinity of the dead was
no longer necessary.  The decorous sadness
that was acted, even in the servants'
hall, imposed by the presence of
death&mdash;especially the death of a very rich
man&mdash;was no longer required.  The butler
might whistle as he cleaned the plate, the
housemaids might laugh freely now, and
Mademoiselle Clairette indulge in a merry
little French chauson unchecked by that
rigid matron in black moire, the housekeeper.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
THE YOUNG WIDOW.
</h3>

<p>
So one of the closing scenes of a sudden
tragedy had been acted in that fine old
English manor-house, standing amid its
richly-wooded chase, the undulating sward
of which was of such a brilliant emerald
that it reminded those who saw it that
Hurdell Hall stood in the most fertile part
of Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
When Sir Harry invited Sir Paget to
visit him and join him in the fatal&mdash;as it
eventually proved&mdash;cub-hunting, his object
had been a nefarious one, but quite adapted
to the tone of a <i>blasé</i> man about town
like himself, the hope of engaging the
beautiful young wife of his elderly club
friend in a very decided case of flirtation&mdash;so
ignorant was he of Eveline's character,
and how her ill-assorted marriage was
brought about.
</p>

<p>
Now he hoped by a more honourable
course to secure both her purse and
person.
</p>

<p>
By will, however, it was soon known
that Sir Paget, to prevent a younger
successor enjoying any of his pelf through
her, had stripped her of everything but
what he had been compelled to settle upon
her for life.
</p>

<p>
However, Sir Harry thought she was
every way a most desirable widow to win,
but her sorrow and sadness were a sore
worry to Lucretia.
</p>

<p>
'Don't weep, dear,' she would say, in
that hard, sharp tone peculiar to some
selfish women.  'It is the worst possible
thing for one's eyes in every way.'
</p>

<p>
And, sooth to say, Miss Hurdell's cold,
steely orbs did not seem even to have
been much afflicted with the weakness of
weeping.
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;we all have our trials, dear Lady
Puddicombe,' she resumed, after a pause.
'Do try to bear this patiently, and believe
it all for&mdash;all for&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'All for what?'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;the best.'
</p>

<p>
'The best&mdash;how, Miss Hurdell?'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;he was so old and you so young,
don't you see,' replied this very
matter-of-fact person.
</p>

<p>
Free&mdash;for whom and to what extent?
Eveline never viewed the dispensation of
Providence thus; but till Olive came with
her soothing presence, every night amid
the darkness of her room, the pent-up
tempest in her bosom&mdash;the tempest of
unavailing regrets&mdash;would burst forth with
loud whispers and sobs till sleep came, as
it always did, at last.
</p>

<p>
Before Olive arrived, Lucretia was ever
by the bed-side of her 'sweet Eveline,'
sitting for hours together, putting
Eau-de-Cologne on her handkerchiefs and Rimmel
on her temples, arranging her pillow or
her footstool if she left her couch for a
chair, telling her stories of foreign life at
Naples, Homburg, and Monaco, and so
forth, for she believed that Eveline had
been left with a splendid jointure, and a
Scottish estate by a former lover; while
Sir Harry lounged about impatiently in
the stables and kennels, with his briar-root,
and thinking 'when will all this end?
And <i>how</i> can she go on as she does about
that old pump?'
</p>

<p>
But a little time before Eveline had been
unconscious of any special blessedness in
her life; <i>now</i>&mdash;with regard to the fate of
her brother and Evan Cameron&mdash;it seemed
as if the restoration of the past, even while
encumbered with captious, fretful, and
jealous old Sir Paget, would be worth
years of happiness.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, my brother&mdash;my brother Allan?
Were there not wicked people enough in
the world to be taken, that you must be
reft from us?'
</p>

<p>
And these words found a terrible echo
in the heart of Olive.  More weary and
empty than ever did life look to both, these
girls.  Everyone seemed to have some one
to love them&mdash;some object in life to
engross them&mdash;but neither of them had
any now.
</p>

<p>
'If I could only die&mdash;if I could only
die!' Eveline would murmur, as she tossed
her sweet face and dishevelled hair on her
pillow, and thought of that grave in the
desert, and betrayed a frame of mind
beyond the conception of mundane Lucretia
Hurdell.
</p>

<p>
And her mind would go back to the old
days with all their brightness at Dundargue
and in Mayfair, before Sir Paget came
into the family picture, and when pleasure
seemed all her thought and occupation,
and care quite beyond her province!
</p>

<p>
And the girl lay there thinking&mdash;thinking&mdash;it
was impossible for her not to
think and surmise.  But for this sudden
accident, how long might Sir Paget have
lived at his years: and how long would he
have tormented her about Evan?
</p>

<p>
As if to infer that she desired his death,
how often had he said in the bitterness of
his heart, before the news of Cameron's
fall in action came, that 'he would cheat
her yet, and live as long as she could do!'
</p>

<p>
She was free now, and not past her
girlhood; and, if in life, Evan would be
loving her still.  But she thrust that
natural thought aside; why brood over it
now, when Evan was no more, for somehow
there seemed in it a species of treason
to her dead husband&mdash;little as she had
loved him&mdash;now that he too was in his
grave.
</p>

<p>
If this was her mode of viewing Evan
Cameron, how little chance had Sir Harry
Hurdell of affecting her heart!
</p>

<p>
Now that Sir Paget was gone, Eveline
repented that his last thoughts of her as a
wife had been bitter, and tried to think of
him as a friend who had been kind at one
time, a husband whose settlements had
been generous, and would have been
greater but for the jealousy that made
him alter his will.
</p>

<p>
She now recalled with something like
an emotion of pleasure, or certainly of
satisfaction, that though she did not love,
she had ever respected him, though his
references to Evan Cameron had always
made her wince and shiver.
</p>

<p>
'Poor man!' she exclaimed; 'and his
soul went out into the night&mdash;in a
moment&mdash;without time for a prayer or
supplication to God!'
</p>

<p>
'So did the souls of our brave fellows
at Tel-el-Kebir and elsewhere,' replied
Olive, who had rather more metal in her
composition than the softer Eveline.
</p>

<p>
Olive knew enough of life and of
human nature to feel certain that her
cousin was too young to relinquish all the
hopes and fears, the many vague and
brilliant dreams of girlhood.  Another
would come, but <i>who</i>?
</p>

<p>
Time would show that.
</p>

<p>
'She'll get over all this nonsense by-and-by,
poor little thing,' said Sir Harry
to his chum, Pyke Poole, as they knocked
the balls about in the billiard-room, trying
canons and so forth for practice.  'She is,
by Jove, the best groomed woman in the
whole stud of our acquaintances&mdash;perfect
in all her points.  I'll go in for her, if I
can&mdash;but it is too soon to begin the running
yet.  Girls' fancies are, however, easily
drawn from one object to another.'
</p>

<p>
'And I don't think she could have
fancied old Pudd much,' said Poole, as
he mixed himself a glass of brandy-and-soda.
'I've seen many a rough spill in
the field, but never such a devil of a
cropper as he came!'
</p>

<p>
'You know I might do worse than
marry such a sweet girl, Pyke?'
</p>

<p>
'You might, by Jingo!' replied Mr. Poole,
with a knowing wink, and thinking&mdash;'Why
should not he himself enter stakes
for such a prize?'
</p>

<p>
'Puddicombe's settlements are splendid,
I hear, but pass away if she dies without
an heir.  No chance of <i>that</i>, I think; and
then some soft-headed Scotch fellow&mdash;if
there is such a thing in the world&mdash;who
loved her, has left her a place in the
Highlands, where one could knock over
the grouse and blackcock every year.
We'll get married before the Derby.  She'll
have had plenty of time to air her grief
and her weeds&mdash;Jay's "unutterable woe,"
no doubt&mdash;for old Pudd by that time.
I've a heavy bet upon Dasher, and I'll
have her in the grand stand on Cup Day,
with my jockey's colours somewhere about
her dress.  She'll look, as she always does,
a stunner!'
</p>

<p>
Poole could not help laughing as his
friend ran on thus, in perfect confidence,
and stroked his long yellow moustache.
Though rather a bit of a reprobate, Sir
Harry looked every inch a gentleman, a
long-limbed sanguine blond, alternately
blunt and overbearing; resolute and
indolent, with the general air of a man who
has seen everything that was to be seen&mdash;done
everything that was to be done, and
'had found nothing in it.'
</p>

<p>
'To speak to her for a space would never
do.  I'll take my time,' he resumed; 'none
but a fool meets trouble half-way.'
</p>

<p>
She would learn to love him in time&mdash;hang
it all, how could she resist!  This
comfortable impression made him feel
quite easy on the subject, and by degrees
the satisfaction that always accompanies a
weak mind took possession of him.
</p>

<p>
Olive never doubted that when Eveline
got over the death, not of Sir Paget, but
of Evan Cameron, she would marry again.
She was too young to treasure a morbid
grief; but Olive would not like to have
seen her Lady of Hurdell Hall, for, with
all a woman's sharp instincts, she had
indefinable doubts about Sir Harry.
</p>

<p>
After Olive joined her, the two girls
were never weary of comparing their
hopeless notes and sorrows, and of searching
the public prints.  Eveline could do
so freely and unchidden now for any
further meagre tidings that might come of
the lost one.
</p>

<p>
An unexpected and startling event&mdash;to
be detailed in its place&mdash;did happen, and
was duly recorded, but was unnoticed by
them; and those who did see it, cared not
to speak or write of it, while others were
unaware of the deep and vital interest it
possessed for them both.
</p>

<p>
'Dear Olive, but for you coming to me
I think I might have lost my life&mdash;my
reason&mdash;certainly my peace of
mind&mdash;everything!' exclaimed the affectionate
and effusive Eveline, wreathing her soft
white arms round her cousin's neck, and
nestling her face therein.
</p>

<p>
The first day she was 'downstairs' was
quite an event at Hurdell Hall, so great
was the fuss made of her by the baronet
and his sister.
</p>

<p>
In her dressing-room she had been fully
attired in her crape dress by Clairette, who
might as well have dressed a lav-figure for
all the apparent power of volition there
was in Eveline.  Again and again she had
tried to bathe her cheeks into some colour,
to smooth her hair, and went with slow
reluctant steps to the drawing-room at
last; and there the extreme depth of her
mourning, her girlish face and figure, and
her pure whiteness of complexion&mdash;the
soft white of the arum lily&mdash;made her
delicate beauty seem more striking than
ever.
</p>

<p>
Sir Harry was beside himself with
pleasure, and when he rejoined the ladies
in the drawing-room after dinner, and
after all the champagne he had imbibed at
table, his attention and extreme effusiveness
were such that Eveline was compelled
at last to say, coldly,
</p>

<p>
'Sir Harry, I wish you would go away
and leave me&mdash;leave me to my own
thoughts.'
</p>

<p>
He urged his extreme joy at seeing her
again after her long seclusion.
</p>

<p>
Eveline had now a horror of Hurdell
Hall.  It was associated in her mind with
three dire calamities&mdash;Evan's death&mdash;though
she had first heard of that from
Sir Harry in London; Sir Paget's terrible
catastrophe, and, collaterally with it, the
strange disappearance of her darling
brother.
</p>

<p>
She must get away, without delay, she
thought, as the atmosphere of the place
seemed to oppress her.  So, in a few days,
arrangements were complete for her
departure to join her parents, who were still
at Southsea.
</p>

<p>
Well, that was not a thousand miles
from Hurdell Hall, thought Sir Harry;
and it was too soon to venture on the
subject of love or marriage yet; but a
time would come, and a jolly one he
doubted not it would be.
</p>

<p>
But, ere that time came, some very unforseen
events had come to pass with reference
to Eveline.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
IN THE DESERT.
</h3>

<p>
Allan had heard of Private Thomas Keith,
of the 72nd Highlanders, who, after being
taken prisoner in Egypt in 1807, rose to
the rank of Aga of the Mamelukes and
Governor of Medina; but the prospects of
promotion in the desert, held out to him
by Zeid, did not prove very attractive;
and here we may mention that the name of
Zeid is of great antiquity, for it was that
of the adopted son of Mohammed, whom
he placed on the Black Stone of the Caaba,
and to whom he gave a wife named Zinab.
</p>

<p>
Zeid's wife had already suggested that
Allan should have his head shaved, and
that a turban or tarboosh should be
substituted for his tropical helmet, with its
red 42nd hackle; so he began to think
that something must be done to put an
end to this life of idleness and annoyance.
</p>

<p>
At times he thought he would affect to
fall into the views of Zeid-el-Ourdeh; get
the blood mare and put a burnous over
his regimental jacket and kilt, and&mdash;leaving
the 'Bedouin girl' out of the category&mdash;take
an opportunity of trying the speed
of the said mare, and escaping.
</p>

<p>
But the time for departing further into
the desert drew near, and no mare was
given him; he had, however, the offer of
a camel, but that would not do at all.
</p>

<p>
He thought of the distress his disappearance
must cause his family&mdash;if deemed
dead, their sorrow; and ere long the
deletion of his name from the army list, and
from his position in what he deemed a
family regiment, and the whole complication
of the situation maddened him.
</p>

<p>
In that Bedouin band were hundreds
of dusky robbers with whom he had not
eaten the mystic bread and salt of the
East, and who owed him neither favour
nor protection; and thus the grotesque
views and oppressive friendship of Zeid
might fail to secure his life at their
hands.
</p>

<p>
He knew that they would think no more
of killing him than of killing a kid, and
he recalled with sufficient disgust the swift
catastrophe of the wretched Holcroft.
</p>

<p>
When rambling on the skirts of the
black tented camp, under close surveillance,
however, Allan observed that the
tomb of the Santon had a remarkably
broad and peculiar cornice round its dome,
that it was curved upward like the rim of
a billycock hat, and that a vine tendril of
considerable strength had ascended, in
the lapse of years, from the base to the
summit of the dome; and thus he
conceived, if he could ascend thereinto
unseen, he might lie <i>en perdue</i>, till the
tribe departed, and then he should be
safe.
</p>

<p>
The day before the tents were to be
struck, Zeid ordered some food to be
procured by his huntsmen, who&mdash;though the
food of the tribe was generally
farinaceous&mdash;succeeded in capturing some of these
gazelles that live in the open plain, where
they browse upon the saline and pungent
herbage.
</p>

<p>
Fully experienced in the haunts and
habits of these animals, Abdallah and
others concealed themselves in a hollow
dug out of the sand and carefully covered
over with brambles, and there they
captured their prey by means of a rude
network attached to stakes&mdash;the former
being slightly concealed in the sand, and
raised by means of a rope pulled when
a number of the herd has ventured
within its precincts.  Thus twenty or
thirty of these beautiful creatures, with
their bright hazel eyes, spiral horns, and
slender limbs were taken at a time.
</p>

<p>
The gun was used only when other
means failed, as ammunition is too costly
for ordinary occasions in obtaining the
supplies of food.  Allan, while hovering
about the huntsmen, effected a final
reconnaisance of the Santon's tomb, and
resolved to make the attempt that very
night.
</p>

<p>
When sudden darkness fell as usual,
instantly after sunset, and no moon as
yet had risen, while Zeid and his family
were busy with their final ablutions and
prayers, Allan&mdash;his bold heart beating
wildly the while&mdash;crept softly out of the
tent, under the uplifted canvas wall
thereof, and crawling flatly on his hands and
knees, with the blade of his drawn sword
in his teeth, began to leave the hated
encampment behind him.
</p>

<p>
It was a time of keen and poignant
excitement.  Every moment he expected to
hear an outcry announcing that he was
missed from his place, or seen even amid
the gloom and obscurity, by the keen eye
of some practised son of the desert.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately all were at their prayers or
engaged in preparations for departure on
the morrow, and, as the distance increased
between himself and the dark camp, his
spirit began to rise, and he thought to
himself, why had he not made this attempt
before?  But, sooth to say, it would
have been impossible, as he was less
watched latterly than he had been at first.
</p>

<p>
Even at the distance of half-a-mile he
did not assume an erect attitude, lest his
figure might be seen between the sky and
horizon, but continued to creep steadily
on, till at last he ventured to rise from the
ground, and strode swiftly towards the
tomb of the Santon, which was about two
miles from the camp.
</p>

<p>
The stars were coming out now, and a
sigh of relief escaped him as he reached
it&mdash;a sigh that ended in an exclamation of
dismay as a tall Bedouin, who seemed to
spring from the ground, so sudden was
his appearance, stood face to face with
him, and in a moment he recognised
Abdallah, the second in command under
Zeid!
</p>

<p>
He perceived Allan's sword in his hand,
and, knowing that he was escaping, drew
a pistol from his girdle&mdash;a pistol the
explosion of which would have proved most
disastrous, but by one trenchant stroke
Allan hewed the Arab's left hand off by
the wrist, and hand and pistol fell on the
sand together.
</p>

<p>
Muttering a terrible malediction, the
Bedouin, wrapping the bleeding stump in
the folds of his burnous, furiously assailed
Allan with his formidable sabre, shouting,
as he did so, something to this purpose:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Unbelieving wretch, you shall go from
hence to hell, where your hands will be
chained to your neck, and you will be
compelled to oppose your face to the
flames.'
</p>

<p>
'Oho!' thought Allan, 'the Koran again!'
</p>

<p>
If he had time or means to give an
alarm, all would be over.
</p>

<p>
It was a life for a life now, and both
men fought desperately; both were expert
swordsmen, and both were filled with
blackest fury&mdash;the Bedouin by the agony
of his wound, and Allan by the peril which
menaced him.
</p>

<p>
After pausing to draw breath for a
moment, Abdallah came rushing on with blind
rage; Allan warded a cut, and, closing in,
caught his sword-hand by the wrist and
held it with an iron grasp; then, adroitly
dropping the basket hilt of the claymore
from his right hand, he caught the shortened
blade and plunged it, dagger fashion,
into the breast of the Arab, who fell at his
feet and expired.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by an instant thought, he
dragged the dead body away, and the
hand and pistol also, to some distance
from the vicinity of the tomb, and, returning,
proceeded stealthily and speedily, if
worn, breathless, and feeling rather sick
by his recent work, to climb by the
branches of the vine up the wall of the
circular edifice, and over its heavily curved
cornice, behind which he crouched down
flat, and there he lay for hours, exposed
to a shower of rain, the fall of which he
hailed with thankfulness, as it would
obliterate any traces of blood in his vicinity,
and also his footmarks from the bruised
branches of the vine which he had used as
a ladder.
</p>

<p>
He knew that, if retaken now, the
discovery of Abdallah's fate would seal his
own; so, if found, nothing was left him
but to die sword in hand.
</p>

<p>
Each respiration came heavily, as he lay
there listening for every passing sound,
and wondering how he had achieved the
first chapter of his escape, and all the
bloody and necessary work so well.
</p>

<p>
Strange it was that his hand should
avenge the miserable Holcroft; but he did
not think of that till afterwards; nor did
he think of the too baleful effect the wet
and damp of the Egyptian night might
have upon his own health.
</p>

<p>
At length the rain ceased, and the blue
dome of heaven appeared in all its
wondrous beauty&mdash;for wondrous indeed it is
by the shores of the Nile, though this
was in the first season of the Egyptian
year, when the weather is generally moist.
</p>

<p>
But the sky is so cloudless, and the
brightness of the moon so intense, that
the natives, when sleeping in the open
air, as they often do, cover their eyes,
as the effect of the moon's rays upon the
sight is more dangerous and violent than
that of the sun.
</p>

<p>
No sleep, however, visited the eyes of
Allan that night; he remained without
desire to close them, preternaturally,
acutely, and painfully awake, and
watchful as a lynx.
</p>

<p>
It was all as Allan anticipated.  Day
had scarcely dawned, and the striking of
the tents begun, ere he was conscious
that his absence was discovered, and more
than a hundred swiftly-mounted horsemen,
with cries and shouts, darted from
the camp in every direction around it
in search, and, if afoot, he must inevitably
have been overtaken; but, concealed
where he was, he lay in safety, though
his heart throbbed so violently that he
seemed to hear its pulsations, as he heard
the Bedouins, at full speed, pass and
repass the Santon's tomb, with guns and
rifles unslung, intent on his recapture and
destruction.
</p>

<p>
He clenched the hilt of his claymore.
If traced to where he lay&mdash;if discovered&mdash;he
could but sell his life, and dearly did
he resolve to do so!
</p>

<p>
He heard their voices, their surmises,
their suggestions, and their threats; and
lucky it was for him that the rain and
subsequently the heavy dew, of the past
night had obliterated the traces of his
footsteps near the tomb and on the
tendrils of the vine, also the traces of the
blood of Abdallah, the discovery of whose
body was greeted by yells of rage that
pierced the air; but the rain and the
dew were ere long to have a baleful effect
on Allan in the time to come.
</p>

<p>
At last the riders seemed to give up
the search as hopeless, and by twos and
threes came slowly back to camp, with
horses weary and bridles loose.  After
mid-day, the tents were finally struck,
stowed away, with all household utensils,
on the backs of camels and horses, and
the whole tribe of Zeid-el-Ourdeh took
its departure in a north-easterly direction,
towards the great desert, through which
lies the route taken by Bonaparte in 1799,
and, before evening fell, the last of them,
like black specks, were alone visible, and
ere long they quite disappeared from view.
</p>

<p>
Now Allan, worn and weary, after a
day without food or drink, slept for a
time, and the moon, clear, bright, and
refulgent, was high in the heavens when
he prepared to descend from his lurking
place.
</p>

<p>
He looked keenly, anxiously, and carefully
round him, as it was possible that
some of the Bedouins might return to
their late camping-ground for some object
of their own; and, moreover, others were
to be avoided quite as much as they.
</p>

<p>
No living thing was visible, and the
most awful silence seemed to reign around
him.
</p>

<p>
Allan descended from his perch, stiff,
benumbed, and well-nigh powerless, to
begin his lonely and perilous journey;
but whither?
</p>

<p>
Ignorant of the country and of the
way to pursue, he knew not that the
canal which leads from Belbeis to Grand
Cairo lay on his left; and after toiling
on without adventure for a few days and
nights, subsisting on dates, wild-beans,
and lotus-roots, with a little water from
an occasional spring, he found himself,
weary, worn, and faint, with pains in
his head and loins, and shivering in his
limbs&mdash;the forerunners of a deadly
illness&mdash;crossing what is the camel-route to
Suez, as he penetrated into another portion
of the desert.
</p>

<p>
He saw occasionally vultures, storks,
and pelicans; and now and then a herd
of beautiful antelopes swept past him;
but&mdash;as he thanked heaven&mdash;no Bedouins.
More than once he came upon nitre
springing up in the sandy waste, like
crystallised fruit.  At times these spots
seemed as if overgrown by moss and
coated with hoar frost&mdash;hoar frost under
a fervid Egyptian sun; and according to
the quantity of the nitre, their fantastic
shapes were either a dazzling white, or
more or less tinted by the yellow hue
of the sand.
</p>

<p>
More than once in his fitful slumbers
by night under the baleful dew, there
came before him in a dream the agony of
his lurking on the summit of the tomb in
momentary dread of discovery, and then
he was again closing in combat hand-in-hand
with Abdallah, the aspect of whose
dark face, with gleaming eyes and glistening
teeth, curiously blended with an idea
of Holcroft, came vividly before him; and
then, when just in the act of plunging in
his shortened sword-blade, he would awake
with a nervous start to find himself still in
solitude with quiet stars looking down
upon him.
</p>

<p>
At last when about to sink he saw before
him the well-known fringes of greenery
and foliage that indicate the line of a
canal, and it proved to be a portion of
that of Moses, and a cry of joy escaped
him when he heard the whistle of a locomotive
and saw the welcome smoke of a train
running westward.
</p>

<p>
How much the sound and sight we deem
alike so hideous spoke to his heart of home,
of ease, of peace, safety, and civilisation.
In short, he soon discovered that he was
midway between Kassassin and Mahsameh
and by a liberal promise of backsheesh to an
Egyptian labourer whom he met, and whose
assistance he solicited, he reached a railway
station and obtained all the succour he
needed from the European officials there.
</p>

<p>
By them he was placed in a train for
Ismailia, and ere long he saw once more
those places which were familiar to him as
having passed them with the troops&mdash;Ramses,
Tel-el-Mahuta, and El-Magfar,
where the Black Watch had encamped, and
where he had befriended Zeid-el-Ourdeh;
and ere long he could recognise, when he
had left the sea of sand behind him, the
white-walled houses of Ismailia against the
deep blue of the sky, and the tall forest of
masts, those of our transports and
warships in the adjoining lake of Timsah.
</p>

<p>
He had no recollection of more, or even
of reaching the railway station.  His heart
beat wildly, his head swam round him, and
a darkness seemed to envelop him.  He
had fainted.
</p>

<p>
On partially recovering he found himself
in bed, but he knew not where, and
dimly seen, as in a glass, he thought he
saw Evan Cameron bending over him&mdash;Evan
looking pale and wan as when he
buried him in the sand.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, God,' sighed Allan, as he closed
his eyes to shut the vision out, 'is this
madness or delirium that has come upon
me?'
</p>

CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
EASTWARD HO!
</h3>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie was a Scottish Episcopalian
of the first class; one whose boast
it was that she always distinguished
Christmas and Easter by mince-pies and
cheesecakes; and who rather looked down
on English Ritualists and Tractarians as
'second chop;' and who never saw a
Michaelmas without its goose; but she
forgot the Michaelmas of this year, and with
good reason too.
</p>

<p>
The sudden arrival in the hospital at
Ismailia of Captain Graham, the missing
officer of the Black Watch, who had been
carried off by Bedouins at Matarieh, and
who was supposed to have shared the
terrible fate of Professor Palmer and his
companions, was duly 'wired' home, like
many other items of Egyptian news, and
caused no small excitement among the
inmates of Puddicombe Villa, Southsea.
The telegram added that he was without a
wound, but was supposed to be dying of
enteric fever, the result of all he had
undergone when in the desert.
</p>

<p>
'Dying!' exclaimed his mother, pale as
a lily; 'oh, it cannot be.'
</p>

<p>
And Olive looked the picture of mute
misery.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie telegraphed to the chief
of the medical staff at Ismailia for distinct
intelligence, and the reply&mdash;waited for
with intense anxiety&mdash;came in its usual
orange-tinted envelope.
</p>

<p>
'Not dying yet, but recovery very improbable.'
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie, with the promptitude
of an old soldier, and full of affection and
anxiety, wished to start at once for Egypt,
and alone; but the three ladies of his
family insisted on going also, so he yielded
to their tears, entreaties, and
importunities&mdash;especially those of Olive, whose misery
was very great; and he had much sympathy
with a young and loving heart.  'Let
no one decry the suffering of the young
because they are young,' says a writer;
as we grow older we get used to pain, both
mental and bodily.
</p>

<p>
Olive passed the hours, previous to
departure, pretty much as we do those which
precede a funeral; everything was done as
a duty, dressing, undressing, sitting down
to meals, and so forth&mdash;seeming to have no
interest in anything, as if for the time, life
and all its interests was over and done
with.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Eveline,' she exclaimed, 'what
advantages men have over us in this world.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course they have,' replied her
cousin, 'but to what do you refer in the
present instance?'
</p>

<p>
'Now, if we were men, we could start
for Egypt alone; as it is, we can only go
with your papa.'
</p>

<p>
'If you were a man, Olive, you would
not think of going at all.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed&mdash;why?'
</p>

<p>
'Little goose!  If a man, would you be
engaged to Allan?  Are you going to
become an advocate for women's
"rights"&mdash;whatever they may be?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;but it is tiresome to have to run in
the grooves of life that men lay down for
us.  Poor creatures, we are only in their
eyes the weaker vessels after all.'
</p>

<p>
'But weaker vessels they make a great
fuss with; but how we chatter!  Oh,
heavens, if Allan's peril&mdash;dear, dear
Allan&mdash;should be so great!'
</p>

<p>
Olive shivered at this exclamation, as
she alternated&mdash;like all girls of a delicate
and nervous organization&mdash;between high
spirits at the prospect of going eastward
and the awful dread of what tidings might
await her there.
</p>

<p>
'Going to the East&mdash;actually to Egypt!
Darling papa, how shall we ever be able to
thank you?' exclaimed Eveline, as in her
energy she locked her slender fingers so
tightly together that the great diamond in
one of her rings&mdash;a gift of Sir Paget&mdash;was
cutting into her delicate skin, and yet she
felt it not.
</p>

<p>
And great was the disgust of Sir Harry
Hurdell, when eventually he heard of this
sudden disposition to travel, the precise
object of which he failed quite to understand.
</p>

<p>
Apart from anxiety about her brother,
Eveline had another thought, and she kept
repeating to herself,
</p>

<p>
'I shall see the land where Evan died&mdash;the
land that holds his grave!  It is a
pilgrimage of love&mdash;but one that is without
deceit to him.'
</p>

<p>
'Him,' meant Sir Paget, or 'Old Pudd,'
as Sir Harry called him.
</p>

<p>
Allan might die ere they arrived, or
after they did so.  In either case, the
famous will of Olive's father would be as
only so much waste paper, so far as the
Aberfeldie family was concerned; but at
this time of trial no one thought of that
feature in the terrible contingency.
</p>

<p>
Their whole idea was to see him; to be
with him; to know the best or worst; to
nurse him well, and to bring him home
with them to the soft breezes of the Sidlaw
Hills, and his native place, Dundargue.
</p>

<p>
So Tappleton and Mademoiselle Clairette
received their orders; packing was
proceeded with; the Continental Bradshaw
consulted, and all arrangements made for
a speedy departure for Egypt, <i>viâ</i> Paris;
by rail then to Marseilles; thence by
steamer, Messageries Imperiales Company,
to Alexandria, when the train could be
taken for Suez.
</p>

<p>
The night before their departure Olive
was so excited that she could not go to
bed, but sat listening to the booming of
the waves as they rolled on the stormy
bluffs of Southsea Castle, while all the past
returned upon her, and when she had last
seen the face of Allan.
</p>

<p>
As she was heard moving about in her
room, Clairette was sent to inquire for
her.
</p>

<p>
'I have a dreadful head-ache,' said
Olive.
</p>

<p>
'Mon Dieu, mademoiselle, why are you
not in bed, instead of shivering there in
your night-dress, at an open window, too!
This will never do; let me coil up your
hair and cover you up.'
</p>

<p>
'Dear little Clairette, I shall be good
and go to bed&mdash;yes, to bed.'
</p>

<p>
Clairette, who knew all about it, kissed
her lady's hand; but Olive pressed her
lips to the cheek of the French girl, who,
in the impulsiveness of her nature, burst
into tears, and then, instead of leaving
her mistress to repose, had a long gossip
with her about Allan, for whose safety
she said she gave up a prayer every night.
</p>

<p>
Appliances for travel are so great and
ample now that a few hours after soon
saw the whole party on board the Marseilles
steamer, and traversing the Mediterranean.
</p>

<p>
Many officers were in the saloon making
their way to join the various regiments,
and to these Eveline&mdash;so young a widow&mdash;was
an object of no small interest.  She
seemed to have ripened into the bloom of
early womanhood, though all her girlish
manner remained with its softness and
grace.
</p>

<p>
Her figure had become more rounded
and developed; her step was firm, though
elastic as ever; and she carried her head
with an air of stateliness that was
somewhat belied by the occasional sadness of
her expression and lassitude of demeanour.
</p>

<p>
To her and to Olive, ever-recurring was
the thought, when fairly off the coast of
Egypt, how strange it was from the
steamer's poop to look upon those places
of which they had read so much of late
in the newspapers&mdash;Alexandria, Suez, Port
Said, and so forth&mdash;all 'household words'
at home now.
</p>

<p>
At the first-named place they saw ample
traces of the terrible bombardment, with
the details of which they were more
familiar than with those of its marble palaces
and porphyry temples of the times of old;
or of the golden coffin of its young hero,
who emulated being a god; of its streets,
two thousand feet in width; and its Pharos,
whose mirrors of polished steel reflected
from afar the galleys of Cleopatra.
</p>

<p>
Suez, with its mosques and caravansaries,
its houses of sun-bricks, amid, or
rather bordering on, a desert of rock,
slightly covered with sand, and where
trees, gardens, and meadows are almost
entirely unknown, was soon left behind
as the train bore them on by Shalouffe,
Geneffe, Faid, Serapium, and Nefishe, to
Ismailia, so named after Ismail Pasha, and
which deems itself the most aristocratic
or respectable place upon the canal, as
the Khedive erected a palace for himself
at the east end of it, and the houses have
all a substantial appearance, with neat and
trim gardens; and the appearance of its
harbour reminded Lord Aberfeldie of that
of Balaclava in the time of the Crimean
war; and still the Lake of Timsah was
crowded with vessels of all sorts and
sizes.
</p>

<p>
Despite the deep and keen interest of
the matter nearest their hearts&mdash;the object
which had brought them so far from home&mdash;it
was impossible for Olive and Eveline
not to be occasionally drawn from their
own thoughts, and impressed by the novelty
of the new sights, scenes, and certain
memories of the land they looked on, for
the crossing of the Red Sea by the
children of Israel took place somewhere near
where Ismailia stands, and certain it is
that, at no great distance therefrom, it
was at El-Khantara-el-Khazneh, the Virgin
Mother and the Holy Child passed when
Joseph arose by night 'and departed into
Egypt.'
</p>

<p>
The wide lake looked now like a land-locked
harbour crowded with shipping.
Great steamers, magnificent 'troopers,'
all painted white, colossal men-of-war
lay like leviathans there, while gunboats,
launches, and steam-tugs were for ever
shooting to and fro.
</p>

<p>
In the streets invalid soldiers of every
kind, in tattered <i>karkee</i> uniforms or red
serges, Guardsmen, Highlanders, Dragoons,
Artillery, and Rifles, were creeping about,
some propped on sticks and crutches,
awaiting their transmission home; and
there, too, might be seen, occasionally,
stalwart Bedouins, dirty Jews, and sable
negroes, howling Dervishes, and many
breeds of Arabs, Italians, and Frenchmen;
the Turk, with his smart scarlet fez; the
Egyptian, with tarboosh and a turban
twisted round it; and in some instances
Moors, with embroidered jackets, white
turban, crimson sash, and trousered to the
knee, with yellow shoes, a scimitar and
antique gun of enormous length; and
though last, not least, the English Jack-tar,
rollicking about and eyeing curiously
the closely-veiled women.
</p>

<p>
The novelty of these sights and scenes
in the minds of Olive and Eveline became
merged at last, especially when they saw
our wounded redcoats and bluejackets, in
absorption about Allan, who, dead or alive,
was then in that place, Ismailia.
</p>

<p>
And, in dread of the tidings that might
await her, Olive already began to pray and
wrestle, as it were, with anticipated despair
and dread of how Allan, if in life, might
receive her.  Until now this idea had never
occurred to her.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, my lost love&mdash;my lost love!' she
whispered to herself; 'what shall I say or
do to convince you that I love you, and
you only?  If gone&mdash;oh, my God!&mdash;no,
no, <i>no</i>&mdash;but if gone, I cannot call you back
to me&mdash;and I cannot go to you.  In
another hour we shall know all&mdash;all!'
</p>

<p>
Aware, as an old Crimean campaigner,
that shocking scenes might meet their eyes
in the vicinity of a military hospital, Lord
Aberfeldie took the three ladies of his
party to the chief hotel, and then, with a
heart full of the liveliest anxiety, set forth
to make inquiries about Allan, to whom
we shall now return.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
AT ISMAILIA.
</h3>

<p>
The putrid water he had drunk on many
occasions, the stone-fruit on which he had
been compelled to feed, the damp sand on
which he had lain under the night dews&mdash;the
watching, fatigue, and depression of
spirits he had undergone&mdash;had served to
prostrate Allan now, and even his magnificent
constitution failed to resist such a
combination of evils.
</p>

<p>
At times he was in a burning fever; at
others in cold, shivering fits, as if his
limbs would go to pieces.  These were
succeeded by feeble listlessness and
indifference to all around him, and then he
seemed as if about to die.
</p>

<p>
He first became quite conscious of where
he was on being roused from a species of
waking dose by voices near him.
</p>

<p>
'Captain,' said an Irish Fusilier, one of
Sir Garnet's own, 'I want ten shillings
from you.'
</p>

<p>
'For what purpose?' asked the officer,
sharply.
</p>

<p>
'To bury my brother.'
</p>

<p>
'Bury your brother, d&mdash;n it!  I gave
you ten shillings for that purpose two days
ago.'
</p>

<p>
'To bury his leg that was, your honour.'
</p>

<p>
'Well!'
</p>

<p>
'And now I want another ten shillings
to bury the rest of him.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you a non-commissioned officer
with you?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir&mdash;Sergeant Carey,'
</p>

<p>
'Well, you and Sergeant Carey had better
be off, or I'll make the place too hot for
you.  As for your brother, you can bury
him for nothing beside the tent-pegs outside.'
</p>

<p>
Every other morning some poor fellow
was reported as dead in the wards, and
they were buried in a little strip of ground
near the canal, a tent-peg, with a label
fluttering from it, alone indicated, in the
meantime, the name and rank of the
deceased.
</p>

<p>
As Allan glanced around him, he saw
cheeks that were pale, eyes that were sunk,
and forms emaciated by wounds, loss of
blood, and fever like his own of the worst
enteric form.
</p>

<p>
A somewhat oppressive odour of hot
soup and poultices seemed to pervade the
wards of the hastily improvised hospital,
where, though wounds were dressed on
Lister's antiseptic system, with a care and
minuteness never before seen on a large
scale in war, yet it was reported, and with
justice, in the public prints, that through
the meanness, economy, and incapacity of
the Government, or the Government
officials, 'the enormous hospital at
Ismailia was opened without drugs,
instruments, provisions, or stores, and was
unable to supply the front with any medical
essentials, and that there was also an
extraordinary lack of hospital attendants.
Officers who lay in the wards tell stories
which are ludicrous though painful, of
neglect and want of common food.  All
acknowledged themselves grateful for the
kindness, sympathy, and skill of the doctors.
The fault was not theirs; but <i>red-tape</i>
finished what incompetence began.'
</p>

<p>
As Allan looked around him, a familiar
figure in the undress uniform of the
Black Watch caught his eye&mdash;it was that
of an officer conversing in a low voice with
one of the staff-surgeons, and he gave a
nervous start as he muttered and closed
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
'It is a chance likeness, and the world
is full of chance likenesses.'
</p>

<p>
He looked again; the figure&mdash;the man
was still there, and he could see his full
face now, with its light brown moustache
and head of close-clipped golden hair.
</p>

<p>
'Great heavens, it is a day-dream of
Evan Cameron!' said Allan to himself in a
whisper.
</p>

<p>
The blood in his veins seemed to congeal
or to circulate like water that was icy
cold.  He had heard that we cannot look
upon the supernatural and live, and so
Allan believed that his hour had come.
</p>

<p>
Feeling that it might be only a powerful
but optical illusion, he continued to gaze
at the figure with incredulity and awful
dread.
</p>

<p>
'Cameron!'
</p>

<p>
The name escaped him, while a strange
sensation crept over Allan, and his voice
as he spoke sounded thick in his own
ears.
</p>

<p>
But it was no optical illusion&mdash;no
disembodied spirit he saw, as he thought he
had done before, but his friend and
comrade still in the body, but pale now and
barely convalescent after the dreadful
wound he had received.
</p>

<p>
He grasped the hand of Allan, and
laughed at the mingled expression of
blank amazement and dismay he read
there, emotions which were gradually
replaced by those of satisfaction and
delight.
</p>

<p>
'I was supposed to be dead and buried
in the sand, like Lieutenant O'Brien in
"Peter Simple," but, unlike Lieutenant
O'Brien, I was not discovered by a pretty
girl treading on my nose,' said Cameron,
laughing, and in reply to some inarticulate
words of Allan, on the side of whose bed
he seated himself.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me&mdash;tell me about it,' said Allan,
huskily.
</p>

<p>
'You could scarcely have left me ere I
began to recover from the syncope&mdash;for a
syncope it was&mdash;only you and Sergeant
Farquharson were not doctors enough to
discover that it was so.  A sense of
suffocation made me struggle up and throw off
my blanket and the covering of light sand
in which you had so kindly tucked me;
and as the blanket fell from my face the
dew refreshed me, and I perceived in a
moment the fatal mistake into which you
had all fallen.  Dark though it was, the
detachment was still in sight, and I could
hear your voices; I tried to call out, but
lacked the power to do so, and a horror
fell upon me, with insensibility after a
time, and, when I recovered, I found a
group of mounted Bedouins gazing at me
in stupid wonder to see a living man half
buried in the sand.'
</p>

<p>
'But how was it that we totally failed
to find all trace of the spot where we
interred you?'
</p>

<p>
'How strange the question sounds as
you frame it,' said Cameron, smiling.  'A
sandstorm came on, and must have
obliterated the landmarks.'
</p>

<p>
'We heard shots as we fell back.'
</p>

<p>
'The Bedouins fired at something&mdash;I
know not what.  They proved to belong to
a friendly tribe&mdash;Bedouins of that kind
who become petty merchants wandering
over the country, trading in such goods as
they can easily transport from place to
place, and fortunate&mdash;most fortunate&mdash;was
it for me that I fell just then into the hands
of men so peacefully disposed.'
</p>

<p>
'And your wound?'
</p>

<p>
'Is healing fast, thank Heaven!  They
carefully redressed it, put me in a camel
litter, and conveyed me to Abu Zabel on
the canal, from whence I was sent, with
others here, by boat to Ismailia on
sick-leave for home.  I heard of your having
been carried off at Matarieh; some of our
fellows who are in the wards told me so;
but I was powerless to attempt your
discovery in any way&mdash;too feeble almost to
think, but the idea of your peril and too
probably helpless butchery cut me to the
heart.'
</p>

<p>
'Any news from home?'
</p>

<p>
'Home?' repeated Cameron.
</p>

<p>
'I mean of my people.'
</p>

<p>
'None, Allan, how should I hear of them?'
</p>

<p>
'True,' said Allan, wearily and sadly,
and in the miserable weakness of his body,
as a paroxysm of shivering came over him,
almost doubting the evidence of his own
senses.
</p>

<p>
Hawke Holcroft had turned up in the
camp of Zeid-el-Ourdeh&mdash;that was startling
enough in all conscience; but that Evan
Cameron, whom he and Sergeant
Farquharson had so regretfully buried in the
sandy grave&mdash;the grave of which no trace
could be found&mdash;should be alive, well, and
chatting with him there, and manipulating
a cigar, outheroded fiction!
</p>

<p>
The wonderful reappearance of the
supposed dead Cameron was the intelligence
in the papers which Olive Raymond and
Eveline did not see.
</p>

<p>
Little could Cameron imagine that
Eveline was so near to him as she was then!
</p>

<p>
Often had he dreamt of her face&mdash;not
when he longed to do so, but when visions
of it came upon him unbidden while he lay
asleep on the deck of the transport, in the
bivouacs in the desert, amid the wards of
the hospital at Ismailia and elsewhere, and
it always came before him with a sweetness,
a loving expression, and a strange spiritual
charm impossible to define or describe.
</p>

<p>
After the mutual revelations of the two
friends, the intermittent fever of Allan
seemed to become more deadly, and by the
time that Lord Aberfeldie arrived at the
hospital he almost failed to recognise his
son, so much had the latter sunk; for, the
temporary excitement consequent to the
meeting with Cameron having subsided,
Allan's health seemed visibly to retrograde,
and each fit of shivering rendered him
weaker than the last.
</p>

<p>
A staff-surgeon had prepared Allan for
the visit of his father, who was manifestly
shocked when he saw how prostrate he was,
and, as they pressed each other's hands,
Lord Aberfeldie perceived how thin, bony,
and wasted those of his son had become.
</p>

<p>
'My poor boy,' he exclaimed; 'how is
this I find you?'
</p>

<p>
'Not dying, father, but very near it, I
fear,' replied Allan, with a sickly smile.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie gazed lovingly and sadly
into his son's wasted face, and thought
of all his mother, his sister, and Olive
would feel on seeing him thus, and in such
a squalid place.
</p>

<p>
Amid the suffering and misery they were
enduring, Lord Aberfeldie thought it strange
to hear many expressing regret that the
war was over so soon, and 'Arabi snuffed
out.'
</p>

<p>
The realisation of Sir Garnet Wolseley's
confident prediction that all would be
ended by the 16th of September, put an abrupt
and speedy end to all chances of promotion
and glory, and now everyone thought
only of going home as fast as possible.
</p>

<p>
In the huge improvised military hospital
much existed, as in every such place, that
proved rather repugnant to the ideas of
a fastidious man, so Lord Aberfeldie
resolved upon having Allan removed to
another place&mdash;a hotel or villa&mdash;whither, when
the surgeon would permit it, he would
have him conveyed by soldiers in a dhooley;
and, full of this purpose, he rejoined
the ladies, who awaited his return with the
keenest anxiety.
</p>

<p>
His hopes of Allan's recovery proved
balm to their hearts, though he spoke more
confidently of it than his own observations
warranted.
</p>

<p>
At the story of Cameron, Eveline sprang
from her seat, while a little gasping cry
escaped her, and Lord Aberfeldie was
rather sorry to see her mother's face
darken.
</p>

<p>
'Evan Cameron&mdash;Evan Cameron alive!'
exclaimed Lady Aberfeldie, incredulously.
</p>

<p>
'Alive, and well!  Old Stratherroch, his
father, used to say that the men of the
Black Watch were deuced hard to kill,
and, by Jove! he was right.  For the
old man's sake, I am glad that God has
spared the boy!'
</p>

<p>
Unable to realise the situation, poor
Eveline felt stupefied!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE.
</h3>

<p>
Olive heard all her uncle had to relate
of the condition in which he found Allan,
and, stealing away, she assumed her hat
and sunshade, and, accompanied by
Clairette, undeterred by any risks she might
run in a strange place, issued into the
somewhat European-looking streets of
Ismailia, over which she could see the great
palace of the Khedive looming in the
distance, about two miles off; and obtaining
the guidance of a passing soldier&mdash;a
Seaforth Highlander&mdash;she bent her steps
direct to the military hospital.
</p>

<p>
In the depth of her love, in the
keenness of her anxiety&mdash;her remorse, too,
for all she had, in some sense unwittingly,
made Allan endure&mdash;she cast the idea of
strict propriety and the amenities of
society to the winds, and, following the
generous impulses of her own heart,
resolved to see Allan, if she could, without
delay.
</p>

<p>
She passed the temporary burying-ground,
with its rows of labelled tent-pegs,
without a shudder, as she knew
not what lay there; anon past wards
where lay patients suffering from
sunstroke and ophthalmia, as she could see
by the sufferers wearing blue-veils and
dark glasses, till she was ushered into
a species of office, where a staff-surgeon
in undress uniform greeted her with some
surprise and <i>empressement</i>.
</p>

<p>
He had not seen an English girl&mdash;especially
one of Olive's style and beauty&mdash;for
a considerable time past, perhaps,
and he looked with genuine interest on
Olive, her half-opened mouth, her soft,
earnest eyes, her trembling lips, and the
tears that clung to her long lashes.
</p>

<p>
Shyly she asked if it were possible to
see Captain Graham, of the Black Watch,
who was a patient.
</p>

<p>
He smiled, and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'Do permit me, sir,' she asked, with
half-clasped hands and her eyes full of
entreaty.
</p>

<p>
'Do be reasonable, Miss&mdash;Raymond,'
said he, glancing at her card, which an
orderly had given him.  'Your presence
would but excite him too much.  It will
be folly on your part to undo all our
precautions simply from a mere desire,
however natural, to speak with or see
Captain Graham.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, sir, if you knew all!'
</p>

<p>
'All that can be done for him is being
done.  Besides, there is danger in being
near him.'
</p>

<p>
'Danger!'
</p>

<p>
'To you.'
</p>

<p>
'I care not.  Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Enteric fever takes a typhoid form at
times.'
</p>

<p>
'Fear not for me&mdash;I am his cousin&mdash;his
promised wife!' urged Olive, piteously.
</p>

<p>
'Come with me, then, but softly; this
way,' said the surgeon, and, taking her
hand, he led her across a corridor, where
hospital orderlies, men of the Army
Hospital Corps, nurses, and others were
hovering, and where Olive narrowly
escaped the shock of seeing a fever-stricken
and attenuated corpse carried out, and
into a plain, white-washed room, where
on a camp-bed&mdash;one of those brought
from Arabi's camp&mdash;Allan lay asleep.
</p>

<p>
Olive, in obedience to a mute sign from
the doctor, made no nearer approach, or
attempt to touch or wake him, but she
restrained her heavy sobs with difficulty,
for the sight of how wan and worn,
hollow-cheeked and pale he was, and how
every way wasted, wrung her loving heart
to the core.
</p>

<p>
Kneeling down by his bedside, she
lightly touched with her lips his thin
white hand that lay upon the coverlit,
a mute action which, in one so charming
as she looked, stirred even the heart of
the staff-surgeon, and then she stole softly
away.
</p>

<p>
'Is there any hope?' she asked, in a
choking voice.
</p>

<p>
As the doctor did not speak, she looked
in his face and seemed to see her answer
there.
</p>

<p>
'He cannot recover, you fear?' said she.
</p>

<p>
'I fear not, Miss Raymond,' said the
doctor, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
She leant for a moment against the
table, and felt giddy.
</p>

<p>
Then, bowing to the staff-surgeon, she
drew her veil close over her face, took the
arm of Clairette to steady her footsteps,
and quitted the sad place in a tumult of
grief and horror.
</p>

<p>
Night came on&mdash;the hot Egyptian night&mdash;and
Allan as he tossed restlessly on his
pillow, all unconscious of who had visited
him, as he looked wearily round his bare
and strange-like apartment by the subdued
light of a shaded lamp, pondered
doubtfully whether it had been a dream or a
reality that he had that forenoon spoken
with and seen his father, Lord Aberfeldie,
and, in the weakness and confusion of
his mind, he was somewhat inclined to
think the whole thing was the effect of
fevered fancy.
</p>

<p>
Ere long Olive was to have him all to
herself!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In a beautiful little villa near the Lake
of Timsah&mdash;one built for the famous
Toulba Pasha, the friend of Arabi&mdash;in
view of all the fleet that lay anchored
there, Allan, after a little time, found
himself in a luxurious apartment, furnished
in European style, yet fitted up and
decorated in the Egyptian manner, with
gaily-painted arabesques.
</p>

<p>
The windows opened upon an arcaded
verandah, the slender pillars of which
were rose-coloured marble, with quaint
capitals of purest alabaster, from which
sprung horse-shoe arches elaborately
carved and inscribed with verses from
the Koran.
</p>

<p>
Palm-trees, feathery-branched bananas,
and arched rows of orange-trees shaded
the lovely garden walks, all mosaic with
polished pebbles; and there, amid the
rose-trees and beds of tulip bordered by myrtle,
a white marble fountain spouted, the very
plash of its ceaselessly falling water
seeming to cool the heated air; and, in view
of all this, Allan Graham lay on his couch
in the care of his mother and sister, but
more often with Olive alone, for she had
constituted herself by right his nurse,
and ere long Eveline found a sufficient
occupation for herself.  How, the reader
may guess.
</p>

<p>
As for Allan and Olive, their reconciliation
came speedily about, as such things
never take long in real life if they are to
take place at all; and the few minutes that
followed are not very describable, as they
remained, hand clasped in hand, in silence
but with a happiness and content that were
inexpressible,&mdash;'one of those rare periods
in life when we forget our mortality and
believe that heaven has begun for us.'
</p>

<p>
At first Allan, fearful of some infectious
nature in his ailment, had implored Olive
to leave him.
</p>

<p>
'Go&mdash;go, Olive!' he exclaimed, faintly;
'do not come near me.'
</p>

<p>
'You dislike me so&mdash;so much?' said
Olive, more faintly still.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no, oh, no&mdash;not that, not that,
when I now know all.'
</p>

<p>
'Why then, Allan?'
</p>

<p>
'Because all the doctors tell me that
there is something typhoid in this Egyptian
enteric fever, and if it were to affect
you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Allan!' she exclaimed, reproachfully;
and, pressing her lips to his, added, 'if you
die, let me die too.'
</p>

<p>
'Olive!'
</p>

<p>
'Do you doubt me now?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no&mdash;oh, no, my darling; but do
leave me.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because this sick-room is no place for
you.'
</p>

<p>
But Olive in the depth of her love was
resolute, and kept her place as a watcher
by his pillow, and day after day, with only
short intervals of rest, was she there
unvaryingly; and as she bent over Allan's
sick-bed she felt how true it is that 'all
the forces of our nature rush towards the
channels of pity, of patience, and of love,
and sweep down the choking drift of our
quarrels, our debates, our would-be
wisdom, and our clamorous, selfish desires.'
</p>

<p>
Allan's life was for a time hovering in
the balance, and Olive, as she sat by his
pillow looking out on the Lake of Timsah,
recalled the pleasant days of their
childhood at Dundargue, where they had
plaited rushes beside the trouting stream,
and he had garlanded her hair with scarlet
poppies and yellow cowslips, and he used
to call her his little queen and wifie,
while the great clouds cast their flying
shadows over the green Sidlaw hills and
the bonnie Carse of Gowrie.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Days gone beyond recall, save in memory!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But, when she feared he might be going
out from her sight for ever, her heart
crew cold and seemed to die within her.
</p>

<p>
She watched him when he lay motionless
and asleep, when his irregular breathing
stirred his sunburned throat and broad
chest, when the perspiration of fever rolled
in globules over his forehead, and when
the cold shivering of the ague followed,
till by watching and confinement her cheek
grew pale as Allan's.
</p>

<p>
There was always a profound and oppressive
stillness about the house and room.
She heard no sound but his breathing and
the ticking of a French clock upon a
console table.
</p>

<p>
Her hand it was that was ever ready to
give the compounded drinks the doctor
ordered, and when ere long he became
convalescent, to her joy, she accompanied
him in his drives around Ismailia, to
Nefische and Serapium, and along the
banks of the Great Bitter Lake, where the
lofty white Indian 'troopers' could be
seen under steam, and boats like those
that are to be seen on the Nile at Cairo in
hundreds&mdash;elegant barques with long
sail-yards and fantastic canvas that fly with
wonderful velocity, and are so ingeniously
carved and painted, fitted up with carpeted
cabins, and deck awnings of brilliant
colours as a protection from the heat.
</p>

<p>
So the days stole on, and, as Allan's
fever seemed to pass away, he and Olive
became supremely happy&mdash;she all the
more so that she had been his chief nurse.
'Nothing,' says a writer, 'tones down a
young girl's passion into apparent
friendship like nursing the man she loves in
illness.  Of course it is there, ready to break
out with the old strength hereafter; but
for the time the sense of utter weakness
on his side, of protection on hers&mdash;the
perfect unquestioned familiarity, the
constant companionship&mdash;have done away
with all the old reserve, and doubt, and
mystery which to unsophisticated young
women is the very food of love.'
</p>

<p>
We have said that while all this was in
progress Eveline had found an occupation
for herself.
</p>

<p>
It was very natural that Evan Cameron
should call at the villa by the Lake of
Timsah to inquire for his friend and
comrade, and it was also natural that he
should meet, incidentally, Lady Puddicombe,
which event came to pass on the
very day that Lord and Lady Aberfeldie
had taken the train to Grand Cairo, to be
present at the St. Andrew Festival, held
by the Highland Brigade in the magnificent
restaurant in the Ezeb Keyah Gardens.
</p>

<p>
Evan was suddenly ushered in upon her
by old Mr. Tappleton, the butler, who had
charge of the household at Ismailia, and
whose rubicund face became quite radiant
when he saw the familiar uniform of the
Black Watch.
</p>

<p>
A little cap of snowy white lace rested
on her soft brown hair; all the rich beauty
promised but a short time ago had been
amply fulfilled, amid the sorrow she had
endured, or in the dignity of her girlish
widowhood.
</p>

<p>
A film seemed to pass over Evan's handsome
eyes; a tremulous sensation, hitherto
unknown, seemed to thrill over his nerves,
and he was for a moment more full of
emotion than herself; but he did not, as
she expected, hasten to take her in his
arms.
</p>

<p>
'Lady Puddicombe!' he exclaimed, while
playing irresolutely with the red hackle
in his tropical helmet.
</p>

<p>
'I am not the wife of Sir Paget now,'
said Eveline, sweetly and simply.
</p>

<p>
'What then?'
</p>

<p>
'His widow.  Is it possible you did not
know?'
</p>

<p>
'He is&mdash;dead then!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Evan&mdash;killed by a fall from a
horse.  I am in weeds, don't you see?'
</p>

<p>
And, if a tearless, a very peerless little
widow she looked.
</p>

<p>
Then a half-stifled cry escaped her as
she fell upon his breast, and her white
hands groped feebly, as one might do in
the dark, about his shoulders, as her arms
sought to go round his neck.  In her
crape dress she seemed to appeal to him
and to his tenderness, more eloquently
than she had ever done in the past time,
and he gazed into her delicate face, as he
took it caressingly between his hands,
with a growing intensity that showed how
he had hungered for the sight of it.
</p>

<p>
The first strong tide of emotion swept
over that parted pair, meeting now so
differently from how they had ever
expected to meet again.
</p>

<p>
In the intensity of her joy, Eveline had
closed her eyes, as if the light of day had
proved too much for them; then their
long lashes began to quiver, the lids
unclosed, and the dear eyes were again
turned wonderingly, searchingly, and
lovingly on Evan Cameron's face.
</p>

<p>
She was <i>free</i>.
</p>

<p>
His pulses quickened at the thought.
He had never ceased to love her&mdash;never
ceased to wish she should be his.  Sir
Paget was dead&mdash;dead as Julius Cæsar&mdash;and
he, Evan Cameron, had been in possession
of a treasure without knowing it&mdash;the
free and unfettered love of Eveline!
</p>

<p>
'Dead fires are difficult to re-light,' said
she, waggishly, while twirling the ends of
his moustache with her fairy fingers.
</p>

<p>
'But, Eveline, with me the fire was
never dead&mdash;as I loved you with a love
that partook of adoration in the dear past
days at Dundargue, so I love you still!'
</p>

<p>
'My poor, dear Evan!' cooed the girl.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;poor indeed&mdash;without you.'
</p>

<p>
So true it was that 'the thing we look
forward to,' as George Eliot says, 'often
comes to pass; but never precisely as we
have imagined it to ourselves.'
</p>

<p>
Could Eveline ever have looked forward
to this when at Hurdell Hall&mdash;to see
Evan Cameron in life again, and feel his
tender kisses on her lips and eyes?
</p>

<p>
Evan had loved Eveline as a maiden;
he had trained himself to suffer, endure,
and think of her as a wife; but now he
thanked God that he had not to think of
her as a mother&mdash;the mother of a wretched
little Puddicombe!
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie, who had fresh views
concerning her daughter, was somewhat
irate when&mdash;on her return from the city
of the Caliphs and Khedives&mdash;the latter,
with perfect deliberation, informed her
that Evan Cameron had been at the villa
to see Allan, and had paid her a long
visit.
</p>

<p>
'He spoke of his old fancy for you,
no doubt?' said Lady Aberfeldie, rather
freezingly.
</p>

<p>
'He did, mamma,' was the candid reply.
</p>

<p>
'He had not the hardihood to ask you
to marry him?'
</p>

<p>
'Mamma!'
</p>

<p>
'Already&mdash;I mean.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course not.'
</p>

<p>
'But I suppose he will presume to do
so in time?'
</p>

<p>
'I have no doubt of it, dearest mamma,'
replied Eveline, attempting to kiss her;
but my Lady Aberfeldie was in no fit of
effusion, and coldly tendered her cheek.
'Was not his escape miraculous, mamma?'
</p>

<p>
'I admit that it was; and now&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Just learn this, dearest mamma; I
married a short time ago to please you,
and, now that God in His goodness has
spared and restored Evan to me, I shall
marry next to please myself.'
</p>

<p>
'It is very strange how some girls get
it into their head that there is a special
virtue in a man because he is poor.'
</p>

<p>
'Evan isn't poor now,' replied Eveline,
stoutly.  'Stratherroch is nearly free, and,
if it were not, I have enough for two.'
</p>

<p>
'Your jointure dies with you,' said Lady
Aberfeldie, sourly.
</p>

<p>
'Dear Evan will never think of that,
mamma; and long before <i>that</i> day comes
every acre, every tuft of heather in
Stratherroch will be disencumbered and free.'
</p>

<p>
'You have schemed out the whole programme.
But as your father's daughter,
and the widow of Sir Paget Puddicombe,
Baronet, you are entitled to look higher.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't want to do so, mamma,' said
Eveline, coyly and laughingly; 'you see,
it is only a case of "heaping up riches,
and ye know not who shall gather them."'
</p>

<p>
Eveline was in a kind of triumphant
and defiant mood, such as her mother had
never seen her in before, for she added,
</p>

<p>
'The whirligig of time brings curious
things to pass, so Lady Puddicombe will
be Mrs. Cameron of Stratherroch after
all.'
</p>

<p>
So the days stole on pleasantly by the Lake
of Timsah.  Allan grew well rapidly, and,
now that she was free and under better
auspices, Evan Cameron daily discovered
in Eveline some new trait of character
that rendered her more worthy of his love
and esteem&mdash;or indicative that those
qualities of passion and tenderness that first
excited his interest in her had ripened
under all she had undergone&mdash;the sorrow
and separation that had tried and purified
their mutual love, as gold is tried by fire.
</p>

<p>
We have said that the reconciliation of
Allan and Olive came about, and rapidly,
too.
</p>

<p>
'Only love me, Allan,' whispered the girl,
as she nestled her sweet face in his neck;
'only love me as you did in the old days
at Dundargue, and I shall be so happy.
Without your love I could not live.'
</p>

<p>
'By your strange actions you destroyed
my faith in you, darling&mdash;and yet I loved
you still.  Oh, think over it all, and
consider if you did not try me sorely, for there
was a powerful appearance of deception
that was unworthy of us both.'
</p>

<p>
Her beautiful eyes were moist with
tears; her hands stole into his, and he
took her in his arms and kissed her
passionately, while a torrent of thankfulness
and joy overwhelmed her heart.
</p>

<p>
'And so that wretched photo was the
key to your apparently inexplicable conduct?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied Olive, weeping, while Allan
kissed away her tears.
</p>

<p>
'Why did you not confide freely in me?'
</p>

<p>
'I was too terrified&mdash;too mortified to
do so, and you were so proud, so suspicious
of me.  I writhed in secret under the
imputation that that man had it in his
power to cast upon me with the tampered
miniature.  I was weak, foolish, Allan, and
every act of mine seemed to be a mistake
and misplaced; but now&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'All is over, and all forgotten.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank heaven for its goodness, Allan.
You never wrote to me after that parting
at Southsea.  Save in your letter to your
mother after Tel-el-Kebir, you never once
referred to me, and then only in terms of
scorn and invective.  Oh, Allan, Allan, all
that was very hard to bear.'
</p>

<p>
But Allan found ample means of consoling
her now.
</p>

<p>
'How happy I am,' said Lady Aberfeldie,
as she nestled both their heads together
on her motherly breast; 'ever since you
two were little children, how I prayed for
this; I reared and taught you to this end,
and God has seen fit in His goodness to
accomplish it.'
</p>

<p>
And now, having brought our 'heroes
and heroines,' to use the old novelist's
phraseology, to this point, need we follow
them into the region of wedding-bells,
wedding-cakes, favours, rice, and old
slippers?
</p>

<p>
We think not.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
